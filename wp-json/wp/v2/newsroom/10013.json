In its debut on the Singular Index, Fluent was also recognized as a top media source in the gaming category and a \u201chidden gem\u201d for driving high-performing mobile user acquisition campaigns on iOS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest edition of the Singular ROI Index includes 27 total lists and 323 potential positions, ranking ad networks, platforms, and mobile marketing players based on criteria like spend, reach, fraud rates, ROI, and retention. Following a year marked by massive disruption and rapid change, Fluent is among 10 new media sources to be included in Singular\u2019s all-vertical, all-encompassing global ROI list &#8212; the most competitive of the group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur proprietary mobile web inventory enables us to provide incremental growth solutions that drive loyalty at scale,\u201d said Matthew Conlin, Co-Founder and President of Fluent. \u201cWe operate in a highly competitive media landscape and debuting on the Singular ROI Index speaks to the impact our solutions make on our clients\u2019 growth objectives and specifically their user acquisition programs. We are excited to be recognized among such a diverse and competitive list of leaders in the space.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An industry-standard, the latest Singular ROI Index is its most comprehensive to date, covering $10 billion in ad spend and nearly 3 billion app installs. Singular introduced the ROI Index in 2017 as the first of its kind analysis of ROI generated by different mobile app ad networks. The 2021 Index offers app marketers insight into top media sources as they navigate the evolving privacy landscape and seek to drive growth for their mobile business in the year ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat powers our ROI Index is that Singular sees both sides of the equation: ad spend and revenue,\u201d said Susan Kuo, COO &amp; Co-Founder at Singular. \u201cOn the one hand, we see what every MMP sees: the outputs of marketing campaigns, the conversions. But on the other hand, we also see what most other MMPs don\u2019t: the inputs into those marketing campaigns. That means costs, creatives, targeting criteria, bids, budgets, and more. Combining those datasets for our customers results in deeper insights into future growth, and for readers of the ROI Index it means a reliable analysis of the top ROI-driving ad networks in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about what makes Fluent a top media source, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=_0smPh0XQSD8SxSBWQze-balTDMY8fAT6NBJztioLKf8dHuLKSIGG4dDk7n8xxhpYk7_sbvkzgW6-pc6_3_EfGhkiDZzF5WvsIBRpgXVTiI=\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Fluent, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluent, Inc.
