The ability to increasingly use first-party data enables marketers to accomplish both goals.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott Rosenberg, general manager of platform business at Roku, said the partnership would not only provide Adobe\u2019s clients with a \u201cseamless way to activate their data\u201d but would allow them to reach cable-cutting audiences who have changed their viewing habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roku boasts 27m active accounts, meaning the Adobe partnership is one of the first times programmatic, targeted advertising has been brought to a substantial TV audience. Modernizing the media buying experience in the realm of TV is a point of interest for Adobe, which\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/theblog.adobe.com\/driven-by-data-the-future-of-tv-advertising\" target=\"_blank\">released a report on the subject<\/a> yesterday (25 March) to time with the 2019 iteration of its international summit in Las Vegas, Nevada.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Saas brand also announced a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedrum.com\/news\/2019\/03\/26\/pandora-expands-programmatic-offering-with-adobe-integration-digital-audio-space\">partnership with Pandora<\/a>&nbsp;that will give advertisers access to the audio streaming service\u2019s full audio, video and display inventory, with the potential to reach 120 million listeners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over-the-top (OTT) provider&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedrum.com\/topics\/roku\">Roku<\/a>&nbsp;has partnered with Adobe in order to clean up its programmatic offering, namely improving campaign scale, frequency and measurement tools for marketers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The partnership will allow advertisers using Adobe\u2019s Advertising Cloud, Audience Manager and Analytics products to mesh their customer\u2019s information with Roku\u2019s first-party data and thus segment and target TV audiences with greater precision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The partnership will allow for targeted automated media buys, as well as click-through and conversion tracking. Marketers will also be able to manage the frequency at which their ads are displayed, while better targeting should also \u2013 in theory \u2013 solve the problem of an ad repeating over and over to the same consumer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/logo-thedrum-desktop.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7711\" width=\"226\" height=\"60\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/logo-thedrum-desktop.png 454w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/logo-thedrum-desktop-300x79.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" \/><figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedrum.com\/news\/2019\/03\/26\/roku-looks-alleviate-advertisers-ott-pain-points-via-adobe-partnership\">Originally posted on The Drum<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":7965,"template":"","categories":[148],"tags":[167,168],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/newsroom\/7710"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/newsroom"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/newsroom"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/7965"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7710"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7710"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7710"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
