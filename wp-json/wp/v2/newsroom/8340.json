(NASDAQ: FLNT), a leading performance marketing company, today announced the launch of&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/fluentpulse.com\/\">Fluent Pulse<\/a><\/strong>, an ongoing insights initiative designed to track consumer sentiment and impact on everyday life as it relates to the COVID-19 outbreak. For its first installment of Fluent Pulse, Fluent conducted a survey of over 1.85 million opted-in U.S. adults. As of March 30, the survey revealed a 70% spike in overall nervousness over the last 20 days among Americans ages 18+. Of those, 46% of U.S. consumers surveyed reported being somewhat nervous or very nervous about the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to only 27% of consumers reporting this same sentiment two weeks prior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to overall sentiment, Fluent Pulse will measure and track consumers\u2019 compliance with social distancing recommendations, satisfaction with the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the crisis and shifts in buying behavior and leisure activities, among other sentiments. Fluent Pulse also found that 83% of consumers are more concerned with the health of their families and fellow Americans than they are with their personal finances or the overall U.S. economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interacting with nearly a million Americans daily, Fluent is uniquely able to leverage its real-time survey and analytics capabilities to help businesses and municipalities better support people during this uncertain and rapidly changing period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs one of the largest independent surveyors of consumers in the world, we believe it is our responsibility to offer access to timely and reliable insights that will better enable businesses, governments and other service providers to establish connections and offer support during this unprecedented time,\u201d said Matthew Conlin, President of Fluent. \u201cAs people around the country are instructed to socially distance, our hope is that Fluent Pulse will allow us to monitor awareness, preparedness and overall impact so that our business partners and governmental authorities can rally to support those most in need. Everyone here at Fluent understands that stopping this pandemic requires all hands on deck, and we are proud to contribute our media inventory, survey capabilities and personnel to this collective effort.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company\u2019s goal is for Fluent Pulse to poll over 5 million Americans on COVID-19-related topics by the end of April using its own advertising inventory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this first installment, Fluent Pulse insights were collected from March 10<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;through March 30<sup>th<\/sup>, via Fluent&#8217;s portfolio of owned and operated media properties. Sourced from a geographically diverse population of respondents, results are specific to the Fluent audience and not reflective of the general U.S. population.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All forthcoming survey insights will be hosted at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fluentpulse.com%2Fcovid-19&amp;esheet=52196726&amp;newsitemid=20200331005237&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.fluentpulse.com%2Fcovid-19&amp;index=1&amp;md5=42e9c9fc983da2d123a4f45ef7a3e85a\">www.fluentpulse.com\/covid-19<\/a>&nbsp;and will provide an ongoing evaluation of public sentiment over time. Fluent Pulse will publish new insights each Tuesday morning along with consumers\u2019 reactions to other milestone events that may occur outside of this cycle. Survey results are intended to provide actionable insight into general sentiment around the outbreak as well as impact on the general population.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"metaslider-id-8344\" style=\"max-width: 900px;\" class=\"ml-slider-3-20-3 metaslider metaslider-flex metaslider-8344 ml-slider  alignnormal\">\n    <div id=\"metaslider_container_8344\">\n        <div id=\"metaslider_8344\">\n            <ul aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"slides\">\n                <li style=\"display: block; width: 100%;\" class=\"slide-8345 ms-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Img__Nervousness-900x500.jpg\" height=\"500\" width=\"900\" alt=\"COVID-19 Nervousness\" class=\"slider-8344 slide-8345\" title=\"Img__Nervousness\" \/><\/li>\n                <li style=\"display: none; width: 100%;\" class=\"slide-8347 ms-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Press_Img__Nervousness_Map_-_Double-900x500.jpg\" height=\"500\" width=\"900\" alt=\"COVID-19 Nervous Map\" class=\"slider-8344 slide-8347\" title=\"Press_Img__Nervousness_Map_-_Double\" \/><\/li>\n                <li style=\"display: none; width: 100%;\" class=\"slide-8346 ms-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Press_Img__Nervous_Subjects_1-900x500.jpg\" height=\"500\" width=\"900\" alt=\"COVID-19 Nervous Subjects\" class=\"slider-8344 slide-8346\" title=\"Press_Img__Nervous_Subjects_1\" \/><\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n        <\/div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Fluent, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluent, Inc.
