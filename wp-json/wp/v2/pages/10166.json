We do not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or abusive.<br><br>In general, we will verify a request by matching the identifying information supplied by the user with the Information we already have for the user. If we cannot verify the user using the foregoing method, we may request additional information, which we will not retain or use for any other purpose.<br><br>For all verifiable consumer requests, we strive to respond within forty-five (45) days of receipt. If we require additional time, which can be up to ninety (90) days in the aggregate, we will provide written notice. Any disclosures we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request&#8217;s receipt and will be delivered electronically in a secure fashion.

We will not ask a California user who has opted out to re-opt-in for one year after the California user opts-out. If the user requests a transaction with us that requires the sale of their Information, we will inform them that they have opted out and if they want to proceed with the transaction, we will offer the opportunity to opt-in by completing a two-step process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deletion of Information<\/strong>.
