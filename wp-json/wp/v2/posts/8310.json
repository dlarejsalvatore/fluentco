The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/resources\/advanced-tv-targeting\/\">convergence of TV and digital<\/a> was also a large focus as speakers discussed strategies for omnichannel activation and outcome-based measurement. Check out all of our key takeaways from the conference below. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. <strong>Advertisers are uniquely positioned to help to shape our impending cookieless world. <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Google\u2019s momentous decision to phase out third-party cookies represents a critical juncture for the advertising industry. All stakeholders affected by the decision have an opportunity to be active participants in shaping our new post-cookie world, but what are some ways to get involved? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the non-profit consortium engaging global leaders to develop industry standards and enable trust in the digital media ecosystem, the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/iabtechlab.com\/priorities\/\" target=\"_blank\">IAB Tech Lab<\/a> is a great place to start. During her session, Lauren Silva, VP of Programmatic Partnerships at CBS Interactive, encouraged attendees to collaborate with the Tech Lab in helping to create an ecosystem that is mutually beneficial for both consumers and advertisers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. <strong>During a time of sweeping industry shifts, an emphasis on consumer trust remains constant.<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While the direction of the digital advertising industry as a whole is yet to be determined, the conversation around the importance of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/resources\/behind-the-rise-of-data-transparency\/\">data privacy and transparency<\/a> has only just begun. With GDPR and CCPA top of mind for most marketers, the idea of investing in consumer trust was a common theme throughout the conference. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Introducing a solution to broader industry struggles, LiveRamp kicked off the event with its new <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"\u201cSafe Haven\u201d (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.adweek.com\/programmatic\/liveramp-unveils-safe-haven-its-answer-to-privacy-demands\/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cSafe Haven\u201d<\/a> product \u2013 an offering that will help stakeholders share customer insights \u201cin a neutral, permission-controlled, privacy-first environment.\u201d In order to gain consumers&#8217; trust, brands must educate customers on how their data is being used while also providing valuable experiences in exchange for first-party consent. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. <strong>The personalized consumer journey lies at the intersection of ethical data use and creative. <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither data nor creative alone can be used to solve a brand\u2019s problems. Instead, the two must be leveraged in tandem to create personalized experiences that matter to consumers. &nbsp;In a discussion on the power of data and creative, TBWA\\World Health\u2019s Walt Geer explained to the crowd, \u201cWe\u2019re too worried about scale. We need to think about the customer journey in terms of touchpoints: how do we communicate with consumers\u2026and where?\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loss of third-party cookies and changing consumer preferences are making it more difficult to address audiences at different stages in the customer journey. In an age where personalization is becoming increasingly consumer-driven and self-directed, brands that can deliver tailored experiences while still honoring consumer privacy will be best positioned to maintain addressability across the changing ecosystem. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Looking Ahead<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s a wrap for RampUp 2020! Check back with us next year to measure the progress of our industry as we strive toward creating meaningful consumer experiences in a privacy-safe, cookie-free world. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To learn how Fluent can help with your omnichannel marketing strategy in today\u2019s changing privacy landscape, connect with us <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/data-for-programmatic-targeting\/\">here<\/a>. \u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In its eighth year, RampUp unveiled new tracks, reinvented its popular Innovation Studio, and reckoned with the fate of digital advertising in a post-cookie world.
