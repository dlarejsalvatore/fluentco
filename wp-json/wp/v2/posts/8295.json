With the help of partners like Fluent, we achieved our 2019 growth goals and aim to show quarter over quarter growth in the coming year. In 2020, we are planning to evolve our feature set beyond credit score with new offerings like credit monitoring and identity protection. As always, all future functionality will align with our vision to help consumers achieve financial wellness.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What sets Credit Sesame apart from other fintech products? <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve seen other apps roll out multiple products with the sole purpose of monetizing users, but the strategic direction and ultimate value to the end-user remain unclear. At Credit Sesame, we\u2019ve spent the past ten years amassing data and focusing on our expertise in credit strategy. Today, we are investing heavily in tech and machine learning, using predictive modeling to help match consumers with the right tools to improve their credit score. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><strong>Learn how Credit Sesame joined forces with Fluent to drive new member sign-ups and increase upsell conversion rates.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button alignleft is-style-fill\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-background no-border-radius\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/resources\/credit-sesame-case-study\/\" style=\"background-color:#102232\">Read the Full Case Study &gt;<\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hailing from California, Derrick Nguyen has ten years of digital marketing experience in both domestic and international markets.
