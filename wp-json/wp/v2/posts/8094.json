Probabilistic Data Providers"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/resources\/streaming-services-whitepaper\/\">rise of streaming services<\/a> has provided consumers with infinite ways to access their favorite video content, while also opening new inventory to advertisers. While ad spots on linear TV were once part of a \u201cspray and pray\u201d advertising approach, the new wave of  Advanced TV \u2013 encompassing OTT\/CTV and Addressable Television \u2013 leverages data, science, and software to enable more granular audience segmentation and targeting. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to eMarketer, the number of US\nsubscription OTT service users will reach <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/content\/us-subscription-video-landscape-2019\">197.7 million<\/a> by 2020. Yet while OTT currently accounts\nfor nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/digiday.com\/media\/inside-race-scramble-ad-supported-ott\/\">30% of TV viewing<\/a>, ad-supported services only capture 3%\nof television ad budgets. Considering that advertisers are still spending up to\n<a href=\"https:\/\/digiday.com\/media\/inside-race-scramble-ad-supported-ott\/\">$70 billion<\/a> on TV advertising annually, Internet-connected\ndevice providers and other streaming players are racing to capitalize on new\nopportunities in the video advertising space. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>The Advanced TV Challenge: Disconnected Ecosystem <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Advanced TV enables advertisers to target and\nserve ads to specific households and subscribers, rather than broadcasting the\nsame messaging to all households. Yet as consumers access video content across mobile,\ntablet and OTT TV platforms, it becomes increasingly difficult for advertisers\nto track and measure user activity throughout the customer journey. In order to\nvalidate reach and performance across key audience segments, advertisers are\nlooking beyond IP-matching to device-level data. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Probabilistic vs. Deterministic Data<\/strong> Providers<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/martechtoday.com\/what-is-identity-resolution-229737\">Identity resolution<\/a> is key to\nunderstanding how individuals access campaign messaging across different\nchannels and devices. Whether <a href=\"https:\/\/video-guide.iab.com\/audience-data-and-measurement#chapter-56\">probabilistic or deterministic<\/a>, device graph data\nhelps advertisers understand which devices belong to the same household or\nindividual, independent of IP address. Deterministic data providers use a\nconsistent identifier such as a phone number or email address to match a device\nto an individual and target the same user across multiple screens. When coupled\nwith TV viewing data, deterministic data can further elevate targeting\nprecision by more closely reflecting a brand\u2019s most valuable consumers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probabilistic approaches draw from thousands of anonymous data points to identify <a href=\"https:\/\/video-guide.iab.com\/audience-data-and-measurement#chapter-56\">statistically significant correlations<\/a> between devices based on usage. For example, if a smart TV, laptop, and tablet connect to the same Wi-Fi network at the same time and in the same places every day, then it can be inferred that all three devices belong to a specific person. Whereas deterministic data providers can authenticate users across devices, probabilistic approaches are based on modeled and\/or inferred data, offering expanded reach but less accuracy. While device graph technology for TV measurement is <a href=\"https:\/\/adexchanger.com\/tv-and-video\/tv-device-graphs-are-not-yet-ready-for-prime-time\/\">not yet without its flaws<\/a>, deterministic data can offer advertisers a good foundation for executing a people-based marketing approach on Advanced TV. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>The Fluent Advantage<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluent offers segments comprised of deterministic data, enabling true addressable TV.
