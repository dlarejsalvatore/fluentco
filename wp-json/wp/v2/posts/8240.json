With major platforms like\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/twitter-bans-political-advertising\/\">Twitter<\/a>\nand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/google-to-restrict-political-ad-targeting-on-its-platforms-11574293253\">Google<\/a>\nadjusting their political advertising policies, presidential hopefuls are\npursuing alternative channels to make themselves accessible to voters. As a\nwidely adopted practice across industries, email is a great way to connect with\nvoters, drive grassroots fundraising efforts, and provide updates on your\ncampaign progress. According to Mailchimp, open rates <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/resources\/email-marketing-benchmarks\/\">for political\nemails measure in at 22.94%<\/a>, slightly higher than the industry average. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We surveyed* the Fluent audience to gauge their plans for political participation and overall attitudes toward email marketing efforts. 20% of US adults surveyed say email is their preferred channel for receiving political ads and messaging, with 11% interested in subscribing to a candidate\u2019s campaign newsletter. With half of respondents planning to vote in the 2020 election, and 15% planning to donate to a political party, candidate or cause, email can serve as a valuable avenue to unlock voter potential. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1194\" height=\"1172\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Infographic-1.png\" alt=\"Expected Political Participation\" class=\"wp-image-8241\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Infographic-1.png 1194w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Infographic-1-300x294.png 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Infographic-1-768x754.png 768w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Infographic-1-1024x1005.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1194px) 100vw, 1194px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Below we outline the framework for creating a successful\nemail marketing strategy for your campaign: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. <strong>Build a strong email list of opted-in supporters <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid spam filters and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/30594\/a-marketer-s-guide-to-getting-past-email-spam-filters.aspx\">ensure greater deliverability<\/a>, make sure all subscribers have opted in to receive your emails. Use third-party email verification tools to keep your list clean and always include a link to unsubscribe in the footer of your messages. Beyond optimizing your website for email sign-ups, consider working with an external partner to drive new subscribers at scale. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, as a leading performance\nmarketing company, Fluent creates immersive media experiences to engage with\nnearly one million Americans daily, gathering information on voter sentiment\nand behavior. We then use these self-declared insights to build precise audiences,\nhelping our political partners acquire net-new advocates and supporters at\nscale.

While getting crafty with your subject line can help to increase\nopen rates, avoid using deceptive subject lines like \u201cRe:\u201d or \u201cFwd:\u201d that\nsuggest ongoing communication with the sender. Instead, opt for a subject line\nthat uses concise language (HubSpot recommends <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/improve-your-email-subject-line#sm.0012salul1068dfvt3313p6fw23hx\">50\ncharacters or less<\/a>), demonstrates a sense of urgency, and starts with an\naction-oriented verb.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. <strong>Use a familiar sender name <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Build a \u201crapport\u201d with your supporters by using a recognizable sender name. For example, the Sanders campaign alternates between \u201cBernie Sanders,\u201d \u201cBernieSanders.com,\u201d \u201cBernie 2020,\u201d and \u201cBernie Sanders for President\u201d to create a sense of familiarity in supporters\u2019 inboxes. The \u2018no-reply\u2019 sender name should be avoided at all costs \u2013 it\u2019s impersonal and will prevent people from adding you to their email address book. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1188\" height=\"674\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Inographic-3.png\" alt=\"Issues that Matter Most to Americans\" class=\"wp-image-8243\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Inographic-3.png 1188w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Inographic-3-300x170.png 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Inographic-3-768x436.png 768w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Inographic-3-1024x581.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1188px) 100vw, 1188px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>4. <strong>Segment your audience based on demo and interest data<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalization is key to making supporters feel seen and heard by your campaign. Make sure to segment your audience and send targeted messaging based on key data points such as where your supporters live or past voter history. Monitor the types of content they have engaged with on your website and create differentiated email sign-up forms that capture their interest in social and policy issues (i.e. \u201cCheck this box to learn more about our plan to address gun violence\u201d). From here, activate drip campaigns with tailored content based on supporters\u2019 responses.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>5. Include relevant information on topics voters care about<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While most of your campaign emails should include some call-to-action (i.e. register to volunteer, sign a petition, donate, etc.) it\u2019s important not to flood your supporters\u2019 inboxes with incessant pleas for donations. Make sure to diversify your content beyond the typical fundraising email, giving readers a better sense of who you are and what you stand for as a candidate. For example, according to our survey, over half of respondents sign up for a campaign newsletter to learn more about the candidate\u2019s values and platform, while 48% are looking for updates on events and appearances.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1190\" height=\"1206\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Infographic-2.png\" alt=\"Attitudes Toward Email Marketing\" class=\"wp-image-8242\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Infographic-2.png 1190w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Infographic-2-296x300.png 296w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Infographic-2-768x778.png 768w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Infographic-2-1010x1024.png 1010w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Jan-Political-Infographic-2-100x100.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1190px) 100vw, 1190px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>6. <strong>Optimize your email for mobile<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Litmus, <a href=\"https:\/\/content-na1.emarketer.com\/email-marketing-2019\">42% of emails worldwide<\/a> were opened on mobile devices in March 2019. To ensure that your message renders properly across contexts, use a responsive design that adjusts based on the device where your supporters are accessing your email. With a mobile-friendly approach in mind, keep CTAs front and center and avoid including long paragraphs and large image files. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you launch your campaign, run A\/B tests to identify the messaging that resonates best with your audience. Be sure to track key performance indicators such as opens, click-throughs, and unsubscribe rates, analyzing findings to help inform campaign optimizations. When it comes to email, clear, concise copy paired with a simplistic design is key to winning over voters and driving engagement. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on how Fluent can help you get the most out of your political email campaigns, contact us <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/lets-talk\/\">here<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">*Survey Methodology: Data was collected on January 7. 2020 via Fluent&#8217;s portfolio of owned and operated media properties.
