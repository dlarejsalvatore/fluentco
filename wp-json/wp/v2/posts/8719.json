Philanthropy has always been a huge part of Fluent&#8217;s mission to leave this world a place better than we found it. From our <a href=\"https:\/\/shelteringarmsny.org\/\">annual service day<\/a> initiative to seasonal fundraisers, our hunger to do good is what drives our leadership team and colleague base to care for our communities and support those in need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In honor of Fluent\u2019s 10th anniversary, we\u2019ve directed $10K to the top charities we\u2019ve worked with over the past decade. As part of a special anniversary surprise in the mail, each team member received a donation card and the opportunity to write in the charity of their choice. Fluent has donated $50 on behalf of each employee to the charities and organizations we&#8217;ve partnered with in pursuit of driving equity and positive change. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

HASK is one of five major emergency food programs in the&nbsp;city&nbsp;and is the largest soup kitchen in the&nbsp;state. Through its daily meal service, the soup kitchen provides over 1,000 prepared, hot meals each weekday to residents in need and through its pantry program, Holy Apostles provides groceries for nearly 20,000 meals each week.

Every year,&nbsp;<em>Farm to Tray<\/em>&nbsp;raises vital funds that strengthen Holy Apostles\u2019 ability to improve the lives of fellow New Yorkers through meal outreach and social service programs.

This year we came up with a few creative ideas for how to raise funds for this important cause.&nbsp; We organized a raffle in which executive team members would donate experiences or other larger prizes. Employees could buy raffle tickets and drop them in the jars for each executive. We all came together as a team for the drawing! It was great to see the excitement on everyone\u2019s faces as they won prizes. We also hosted a \u201cCocktails for a Cure\u201d happy hour during which people could purchase premade cocktails to raise money! We had a bar cart that we walked around the office, and people could choose which cocktail they wanted. This was a great way to raise awareness and funds at the same time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/image-13-768x1024.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"8743\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/image-13.png\" data-link=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/?attachment_id=8743\" class=\"wp-image-8743\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/image-13-768x1024.png 768w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/image-13-225x300.png 225w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/image-13-1152x1536.png 1152w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/image-13-1536x2048.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_7821-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"8744\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_7821-scaled.jpeg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/?attachment_id=8744\" class=\"wp-image-8744\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_7821-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_7821-225x300.jpeg 225w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_7821-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_7821-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/IMG_7821-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What did the experience of participating in Cycle for Survival mean to you?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attending any Cycle for Survival event is incredibly powerful.
