Powered by first-party, self-declared data, the Political Pulse\noffers insight into the hot button issues that matter most to US adults today.\nInteracting with nearly 1 million Americans daily across our owned and operated\nportfolio of sites, we leverage our real-time survey capabilities to better\nunderstand voter sentiment and behavior. All results are weighted based on US\nCensus for gender, age, and income to help ensure overall representativeness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>This Week in Politics <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This Thursday, ten presidential\ncandidates will take the stage in Houston, Texas for the third round of\nDemocratic debates. Stringent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/resources\/fundraising-democratic-debates\/\">qualification\nrequirements<\/a> enforced by the DNC have narrowed the playing field, making\nthis the first debate to feature all the top-tier candidates together on one stage.\nAhead of the debates, 27% of Americans remain unsure of their plans to vote,\nwith nearly 19% reporting they do not intend participate next November.\nRegardless of intention to vote, only 32% of US adults want to see Trump\nre-elected next year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the wake of the deadly mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, it\u2019s no surprise that 37% of Americans believe that gun violence is the top social issue facing the nation today. In response to the mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso last month, Walmart recently announced that it will <a href=\"ill%20stop%20selling%20handgun%20ammunition%20and%20%22short-barrel%20rifle%20ammunition,%22%20such%20as%20the%20.223%20caliber%20and%205.56%20caliber,%20that%20can%20also%20be%20used%20on%20assault-style%20weapons\">stop selling handgun ammunition<\/a> and &#8220;short-barrel rifle ammunition&#8221; that can be used on assault-style weapons. The big-box retailer will also prohibit open carry in its stores and is actively pushing Congress to enact gun safety measures. 61% of Democrats agree with Walmart\u2019s decision to end the sale of handguns and some ammunition in their stores, while only 37% of Republicans and 38% of Independents share this sentiment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Immigration and\nclimate change are also likely to be discussed at this Thursday\u2019s debates. While\nthe total number of arrests at the border has <a href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/administration\/460539-arrests-at-southern-border-drop-to-64k-in-august\">decreased by 22%<\/a> from July to August, the border\ncrisis is still top of mind \u2013 30% of Americans believe that immigration is the\ntop policy issue facing the US right now. Climate change is also quickly becoming\none of the most divisive issues of the 2020 primary. With sharp divides over full\nfracking bans and the use of nuclear energy emerging from CNN\u2019s seven-hour <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/2019\/democrats-climate-town-hall\/highlights-2020-climate-change\">climate\ntown hall<\/a> last week, the climate conversation is likely to carry over to\nthe debate stage this Thursday. Today, only 13% of Americans identify climate\nchange as a top social issue. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find more learnings from this week\u2019s survey <a href=\"https:\/\/fluentpoliticalpulse.com\/\">here<\/a>.
