Consumers want more transparency and control over which entities&nbsp;get&nbsp;visibility, trackability, and usability of the information collected during their internet activities. \u202fWhile&nbsp;policy changes like GDPR and CCPA&nbsp;have&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;accelerated these efforts, Google\u2019s&nbsp;plan&nbsp;to eliminate&nbsp;third-party cookies by 2022&nbsp;has&nbsp;officially&nbsp;put the entire&nbsp;ad&nbsp;industry&nbsp;on notice.&nbsp;With essentially all browser traffic soon either disabling or limiting&nbsp;third-party cookies, the industry will need to find a new currency to facilitate targeting, frequency capping, and attribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are&nbsp;many&nbsp;initiatives underway&nbsp;\u2013 such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.chromium.org\/2020\/01\/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox<\/a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.iab.com\/blog\/project-rearc-an-industry-collaboration-to-rearchitect-digital-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IAB\u2019s Project&nbsp;Rearc<\/a>&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;that encourage&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;in&nbsp;pursuit of&nbsp;identifying solutions that&nbsp;help&nbsp;to&nbsp;improve the&nbsp;digital ad ecosystem.&nbsp;The challenge is going to be standardizing something that works across channels, though I believe the&nbsp;most likely and realistic option would be to move to an identity-based identifier that&nbsp;is&nbsp;sourced from&nbsp;first-party,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/resources\/advanced-tv-targeting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">deterministic<\/a>&nbsp;data.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Considering&nbsp;these changes, how&nbsp;can brands, specifically those in the CPG or retail category,&nbsp;better connect with and tailor the consumer&nbsp;experience to new and existing customers? \u202f&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential move to an identity-based identifier presents a huge challenge to CPG companies, publishers, and other players who don\u2019t have the same type of registration-based data set that\u2019s available in the walled gardens.&nbsp;For brands, CPG or otherwise, the most critical thing they can do is&nbsp;start cultivating as much deterministic,&nbsp;first-party data as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether directly, or through a partner like Fluent, brands need to create&nbsp;a value exchange in which&nbsp;a&nbsp;consumer knowingly and willingly provides&nbsp;their data and the marketing permissions to use it. Beyond&nbsp;this, brands need to focus on scale and portability,&nbsp;making&nbsp;sure they have the infrastructure in place to manage and distribute that data.
