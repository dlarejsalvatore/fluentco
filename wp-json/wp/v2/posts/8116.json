The name of the game is customer acquisition (otherwise known as lead generation), and it involves attracting new customers to your brand with the intention of converting one-time buyers into long term customers. 57% of B2C brands recognize <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"customer acquisition (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/chart-na1.emarketer.com\/230746\/critical-marketing-initiatives-according-b2b-b2c-marketers-worldwide-q1-2019-of-respondents\" target=\"_blank\">customer acquisition<\/a> as a critical marketing initiative, ranking it above brand awareness and customer marketing on their list of top priorities. With that in mind, here are some important tips for scaling your customer acquisition strategy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Customer Acquisition Strategy<\/strong>: Getting Started<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To start, it is important to identify your target audience and the channels where they\u2019re most active. You should have a good sense of what your ideal customer is looking for in a product or service, as well as the problem or pain points your offering can help to address. The exact formula you use to build your customer base should be largely informed by your brand\u2019s growth goals. Here are five tactics that can be used in tandem to enhance your company&#8217;s customer acquisition strategy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. Create a <strong>partnership program<\/strong> to tap into new audiences.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>33% of marketers and PR professionals worldwide say that <a href=\"https:\/\/content-na1.emarketer.com\/influencer-marketing-roundup-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">influencer marketing<\/a> is an effective channel for driving sales. Collaborate with influencers or other growing companies in the same industry to exchange guest posts and social media links. Partnership programs can help build your referral base and attract interest in your brand, especially when leveraging enticing incentives like discounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. <strong>Develop an SEO strategy<\/strong> to improve your search rankings. <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s probably not the first time you\u2019ve read this, and it won\u2019t be the last. Optimizing your <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/what-is-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\">search rankings<\/a> can be one of the best tools in your arsenal to find new customers. One useful strategy is creating category clusters that lead back to individual topic pages on your company\u2019s website. When executed properly, SEO is a cost-effective way to bring more organic traffic to your site and increase conversions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. Leverage social media to build a loyal following.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating and sharing high-value content with your followers is a great way to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"build awareness (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.drift.com\/learn\/customer-acquisition\/\" target=\"_blank\">build awareness<\/a> and encourage potential customers to interact with your brand. While organic social offers a perfect platform to craft your brand\u2019s personality, paid social can help you deliver more targeted messaging to precise audience segments. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>4. Use paid search advertising to drive traffic to your website. <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/ppc\" target=\"_blank\">Pay-per-click<\/a> or PPC allows marketers to advertise within the sponsored listing of a search engine or partner site. Paid search ads appear alongside organic search results and cost the advertiser a fixed amount each time someone clicks on that result. As a supplement to a robust organic search strategy, PPC can help your brand rank for difficult keyword terms and improve the likelihood of target customers finding your site. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>5. Utilize <strong>email marketing<\/strong> to stay connected with consumers. <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As the <a href=\"https:\/\/content-na1.emarketer.com\/deals-drive-greater-engagement-on-shoppers-favorite-brand-communication-channel-email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">most popular method<\/a> for Internet users to stay in touch with retailers, email is a great way to nurture the leads you\u2019ve already collected. Use email as a channel to communicate product information, new content, discounts, and company updates. When used in moderation, email can help to keep your brand top of mind while also providing additional value to the customer. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Customer Acquisition Strategy: Next Steps<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re a new company looking to grow your customer base, or an established brand striving to drive long-term retention, customer acquisition is the best place to start.
