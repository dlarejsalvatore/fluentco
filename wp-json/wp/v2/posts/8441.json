We have the largest in-store and item-level offers available as well as online and app-to-app offers. You can earn cash back on grocery items, online purchases, grocery delivery and pickup &#8211; really the list goes on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What characteristics define a quality Ibotta user? What KPIs do you look at to measure quality?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking technically, our core audience is millennial women who are the primary household shopper and more likely to have children. It\u2019s the people who like to save up on the have-to-haves and splurge on the nice-to-haves. Beyond that, our audience extends to anyone who is looking to save a little money. Who doesn\u2019t want that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Based on your experience, what is the largest driver of success when running a user acquisition campaign?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of our biggest drivers of success is operating as a performance-focused team. Every dollar we spend, every new tactic we try, is driving towards increasing efficiencies and lowering CPAs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What steps are you taking to diversify your UA strategy?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We are constantly testing and evaluating new sources of acquisition. We focus on key indicators to monitor performance and understand the value of small tests. Once we identify what is going to drive the most value to the business, we then explore ways to improve and scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What are some of the biggest challenges app marketers face when it comes to acquiring new users? What is Ibotta doing to address these challenges?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest challenges we come across is advertising noise. We focus on refining and optimizing simple and easy to understand value props to keep the confusion down. If it\u2019s too complicated or asking too much, most users won\u2019t give you the time of day even if you\u2019re literally giving away free money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What are your predictions for the future of mobile shopping and savings apps? What is Ibotta doing to lead the charge in this arena?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As we navigate some crazy and confusing times, shoppers are getting more and more comfortable with doing their shopping from their couch. We just recently launched online grocery cash back where users can get cash back on item-level CPG offers for online grocery orders at retailers like Walmart, Instacart, Target, Amazon\/Whole Foods, Shipt, Safeway, and more. As consumers\u2019 needs change, Ibotta continues to provide a rewarded shopping experience no matter where customers shop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn how Ibotta joined forces with Fluent to drive high LTV mobile app users at scale.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-background no-border-radius\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/resources\/ibotta-case-study\/\" style=\"background-color:#102232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/resources\/ibotta-case-study\/ noopener noreferrer\">Read the Full Case Study Here &gt;<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As Sr. Marketing Associate, User Acquisition at Ibotta, Matt Rome manages paid search, programmatic media, referral programs, and affiliate partners.
