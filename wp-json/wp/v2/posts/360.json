Today, consumers will rarely answer a call from an unknown number (guilty!), let alone spend time on the phone with a salesperson pitching an unfamiliar product.\u00a0Cue inbound call marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers often defer to digital channels to drive engagement, but let\u2019s not forget the untapped potential of the phone call. While the telephone has been around for the past 140 years, the inception of the smartphone has repositioned the inbound call as valuable tool for marketers. 90% of all customer conversations take place via phone, and calls drive 10 times more purchases than clicks.<\/p>\n<p>The assumption that the modern consumer would rather hide behind a screen than place a call is a common misconception. As compared to their older counterparts, 36% of Millennials have clicked on a call button in an online or mobile ad in the past 6 months and a quarter of those have purchased a product or service via call button during that same period. Bottom line: people (even Millennials!!) like to talk, and brands should listen up.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7098\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/insight\/marketing-to-millennials\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-7098 \" src=\"http:\/\/n690p309p162lono41z3ayt1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pay-per-call-stats.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n690p309p162lono41z3ayt1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pay-per-call-stats.jpg 531w, https:\/\/n690p309p162lono41z3ayt1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pay-per-call-stats-300x189.jpg 300w\" alt=\"Click to call ads\" width=\"544\" height=\"342\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/insight\/marketing-to-millennials\/\">Source: Fluent<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h1>What is Inbound Call Marketing?<\/h1>\n<p>Often referred to as \u201ccall commerce,\u201d inbound call marketing involves driving, tracking, and optimizing inbound phone calls as a form of lead generation. Inbound callers are warm leads; they have already made contact with your brand through online marketing efforts. After identifying a need for your product or service they want to determine if your offering is the right fit. They\u00a0are now reaching out, typically to a sales line, for more information.<\/p>\n<p>Inbound call marketing campaigns are usually measured on a performance basis. They allow marketers to engage in meaningful conversations with leads on their path to becoming customers. As drivers of inbound calls, publishers and performance marketing agencies get paid based on KPIs such as call duration, call outcome, or simply driving a qualified call to an advertiser.<\/p>\n<h1>Why Use Inbound Call Marketing?<\/h1>\n<p>A cold call to a prospect can often be a shot in the dark, but inbound callers are declaring their interest in your product or service the moment they dial the phone. Outbound call marketing (or cold calling) falls at the top of the consumer funnel. Inbound calls are a downstream marketing tactic: callers have already downloaded your content, subscribed to your newsletter, or even asked to receive text updates from your business. Now it\u2019s up to you, the advertiser, to drive your value proposition home.<\/p>\n<p>All inbound calls are 100% user initiated, making inbound call marketing a highly effective acquisition channel. For marketers, this means higher engagement, higher quality leads, and most importantly, more conversions. In fact, inbound calls have proven to be more effective than web-based leads; research shows that\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/inbound-call-strategy-infographic\">69% of people are more likely to hit a call button on a mobile phone<\/a>\u00a0than going to a website.<\/p>\n<h1>How Does Inbound Call Marketing Work?<\/h1>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7099\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invoca.com\/pay-per-call\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-7099 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/n690p309p162lono41z3ayt1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/ppc-how-it-works.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/n690p309p162lono41z3ayt1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/ppc-how-it-works.png 660w, https:\/\/n690p309p162lono41z3ayt1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/ppc-how-it-works-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/n690p309p162lono41z3ayt1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/ppc-how-it-works-300x300.png 300w\" alt=\"Inbound Call Marketing Infographic\" width=\"660\" height=\"660\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invoca.com\/pay-per-call\/\">Source: Invoca<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>While consumers can certainly drop a line to your business after entering a query on a desktop, let\u2019s focus on the mobile journey.

Make your contact info easily accessible.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, when we have a question, we want to speak with a real person for an answer in real time. Make it easy for a prospect to get in touch with your sales team, on their own terms. Plaster your phone number on your website, lead forms, emails, and landings pages. And don\u2019t forget to test the placement, size, and color of your phone numbers to optimize for inbound calls.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Add click-to-call buttons to your mobile campaigns.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Inbound call marketing was practically made for mobile (or at least suits it best). While form fills and live chats lend themselves to desktop interactions, the click-to-call button reigns supreme on mobile. Make your call to action as clear as possible so prospects understand why they should dial and who will pick up.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Use real-time call tracking to ensure proper attribution and increase your inbound call volume.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/go.invoca.com\/wc-calls-are-the-new-clicks-ebook-lp?utm_source=hubspot&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=b2b-ebook\">recent Invoca survey<\/a>\u00a0of marketers, 60% of respondents don\u2019t know which of their marketing campaigns drive inbound calls and 68% are unable to track inbound calls in their marketing automation and CRM. Call tracking provides visibility into your pay-per-call campaign, allowing you to capture the keyword, ad, and landing page that a prospect viewed before making a phone call. At a more basic level, call frequency and duration can also serve as proxies for \u201ccall quality.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><strong><em>Integrate call tracking with your marketing automation and CRM system.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Syncing call tracking with your marketing automation system can give you a 360 view into your buyers\u2019 path to purchase. Use \u201ccall intelligence\u201d based on consumers\u2019 previous online activity to route callers or craft highly relevant messaging. For example, if a prospect has already connected with a sales rep, follow up with content that speaks to their use case and pain points. If a prospect is just learning about your product, send them collateral that will help nudge them down the funnel.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Leverage SMS to drive high-value inbound calls.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Beyond phone calls, Millennials and the 35+ crowd alike\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/insight\/marketing-to-millennials\/\">use their smartphones most often for messaging<\/a>.
