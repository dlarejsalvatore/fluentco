While this may explain why only 4% of consumers surveyed plan to do most of their holiday shopping on Cyber Monday, free shipping (42%) and flash sales and discounts (30%) are the top two factors most likely to entice shoppers to buy gifts online. When it comes to e-commerce, respondents did not have a clear preference between purchasing gifts via Amazon (23%) or other retailer websites like Target or Walmart (22%). &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Holiday Shopping: Most Popular Gifts of 2019<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While 58% of the Fluent audience prefers to give their loved ones a physical holiday gift, more than half (66%) would prefer to receive money or a gift card in their stocking. 14% of those surveyed are planning to gift a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/resources\/subscription-marketing-whitepaper\/\">subscription service<\/a> this holiday season, with clothing boxes (JustFab, Frank and Oak, etc.), personal care boxes (Dollar Shave Club, Birchbox, etc.), and food\/snack boxes (Graze, HelloFresh, etc.) among the most popular. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> Check out the infographic for more findings: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2501\" height=\"13597\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Fluent-Holiday-Shopping-Infographic.jpg\" alt=\"Holiday Shopping Infographic\" class=\"wp-image-8130\"\/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>eMarketer predicts that total US retail sales will climb 3.8% to $1.008 trillion this holiday season, making 2019 the first-ever trillion-dollar year.
