When she&#8217;s not geeking out over data, Andrea and her husband enjoy boating, fishing, hanging out on the beach, and running around with the kids and grandkids. While she currently resides in Perdido Key, Florida, Andrea visits our NYC offices often to collaborate and strategize with her team.<\/p>\n<p>We sat down with Andrea to learn more about her career and tips for becoming a strong, female leader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. What are the key attributes that make a successful leader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look at the\u00a0<strong>big picture<\/strong>, then set the vision &amp; expectations and get buy-in<\/li>\n<li><strong>Listening<\/strong>\u2026.Listening intently<\/li>\n<li><strong>\u201cPerspire\u201d<\/strong>\u2013 work hard &amp; set the example<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t \u201cbark\u201d\u00a0<\/strong>at people \u2013 treat everyone with respect and be your team\u2019s biggest fan<\/li>\n<li><strong>Transparency &amp; Consistent Feedback<\/strong>\u2013 everyone should always know where they stand &#8211; when they are excelling and when they are missing the mark<\/li>\n<li><strong>Build a team<\/strong>\u2013 even in an individual sport like sales, it\u2019s critical to build a team that shares information, covers for one another, cheers on successes, collaborates, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>2. Do you have any advice for women starting to navigate a male-dominated work environment?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are two things:\u00a0 FIRST &#8211; \u00a0Stop\u00a0focusing on it being male dominated!\u00a0 Instead, focus on what you can do to contribute to the success of the company and the success of others.\u00a0 Through that, you will build relationships that will last throughout your career and create opportunities to expand your scope of influence.\u00a0 SECOND \u2013 find opportunities to help other women succeed.\u00a0 Mentor.\u00a0 Support someone on a project.\u00a0 Brainstorm.\u00a0 Etc.\u00a0 Essentially, take action to help other women succeed vs complaining about every little infraction, real or perceived.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. What does innovation mean to you in a fast-paced business world?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Understanding what clients need, and then leveraging internal assets to develop scalable &amp; repeatable solutions to help them grow their business.\u00a0 Only today, we need to do it faster, \u00a0with more precision, and digitally first.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. How has sales evolved with the development of new tools and technologies?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While we have new tools that we can leverage, B2B Sales, as a practice, still retains the fundamental goals that it always has:\u00a0 help our clients make money, save money, or save time.\u00a0 To do that, we need to have a natural curiosity to understand the client\u2019s business and learn their challenges.\u00a0 Through that dialog, we can craft a solution that precisely meets their needs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Is there any advice you would give to your younger self, knowing what you know now?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That there was wisdom in the ill-received guidance that a boss gave me one time.\u00a0 He told me that \u201cevery day above ground is a good day\u201d.\u00a0 In other words, don\u2019t sweat the small setbacks.\u00a0 Learn from them, but keep on moving (and looking) forward to get to your goal.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In celebration of Women&#8217;s History Month, we&#8217;re highlighting women in leadership at Fluent who inspire us to learn, innovate, and connect every day.Meet Andrea Haldeman, SVP of Sales at Fluent. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/blog\/qa-with-andrea-haldeman\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":7571,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[189],"blog_category":[135],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7570"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7570"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7570\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/7571"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7570"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7570"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7570"},{"taxonomy":"blog_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/blog_category?post=7570"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
