Even though we are both fitness enthusiasts, we were by no means cyclists. From the get-go, we knew it would be hard, but we were excited to train and recruit friends and colleagues to join us on this journey. I don\u2019t think we realized how challenging this trip would be until we started riding through mud 10 minutes into our first day!<\/p><p>We gave ourselves a high fundraising goal and have to say it felt lofty at the beginning. It was incredible to see how quickly we were able to activate our networks and felt great to watch the numbers climb day after day. Not only did we reach our goal, but we surpassed it \u2013 <strong>we are close to  $42k  raised, or 285 bikes<\/strong> donated! It feels amazing to know that we were able to change the lives of so many people who will now have access to a reliable means of transportation.  <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>An Inside Look at the Bike Challenge<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each day, we woke up at 6 am (or earlier!) to hit the road and beat the heat. After a few hours of cycling, we&#8217;d take a break to enjoy a homemade, roadside lunch courtesy of our amazing guide. With another 30 &#8211; 70 miles behind us, we&#8217;d arrive at our campground in the early evening. After gathering together to share a meal and recap of our day, we&#8217;d then retire to our tents and rest up for another long day of cycling. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_6260.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8202\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_6260.jpg 4032w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_6260-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_6260-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_6260-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What was your favorite part of the trip?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Team Comradery<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My favorite was always at the end of each day when we finally reached the campsite.

We were challenging ourselves to go outside our comfort zone for the greater good of others.

Biking down the road past schools and villages and having all the children run out to the road to say hello and wave was incredible. Killi was the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Walking up to a hill in the bush to listen to the Massai sing and dance as the setting sun turned the sky bright pink around the mountain was the most beautiful experience of my life. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a remote employee, I was also so glad to spend some time with co-workers that shared similar passions with me.

We live in a world of running water, massive food supply, electricity, and access to other conveniences at our fingertips. I left the experience feeling like I needed to donate my entire apartment and live a more \u201cminimalist\u201d life here in the U.S.  This trip helped me learn to be more grateful for what I have and take less for granted.&#8221; <em>&#8211; Tracey Brower \u2013 Sr. Manager, Media Operations &nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Strength<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This trip was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life and changed me as a person. Never in a million years did I think I could bike 250 miles in 5 days. Now I\u2019m hooked on cycling and training for a triathlon with my boyfriend.  Every time I am doing something difficult, I think to myself, if I could make it on that bike the last day in Africa, I can make it through this.&#8221; <em>&#8211; Kelsey Buxton &#8211; Platform Growth Specialist<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Inspiration<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This was the most fulfilling trip I\u2019ve ever taken in my life. From start to finish I felt like I was giving back to a community that needed support and helping improve lives. Full transparency\u2026I nearly teared up on the bike ride. As we rode our bikes through the small villages and passed small schools, the children and community would run to the street and cheer us on, \u201cJAMBO\u201d and say, \u201cThank You.\u201d There are so many people and communities in need \u2013 to find a method to give them a helping hand is truly inspiring. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was also astonished by the number of family and friends that donated to our team and wanted to learn more about how they could help. Some of my largest donors were old friends from middle school and high school who I haven\u2019t seen or spoken to in over a decade. Many of them donated a bike or two which encouraged me throughout the trip and made me feel proud of being able to support such a great cause.  <em>&#8211; Willis Nelson &#8211; Sales Director, Mobile<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_1569.jpg\" alt=\"Hiking with the Fluent Team\" class=\"wp-image-8205\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_1569.jpg 4032w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_1569-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_1569-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/IMG_1569-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Find out more about&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/worldbicyclerelief.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">World Bicycle Relief<\/a>&nbsp;and learn how you can help make a difference&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"here (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/worldbicyclerelief.org\/donate\/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This year, six Fluent Dream Grant recipients joined forces to raise funds for World Bicycle Relief, a non-profit organization that addresses the need for reliable, affordable transportation in developing countries.
