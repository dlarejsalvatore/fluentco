My grandparents on both sides immigrated to the United States to build a new life, and from them, I\u2019ve learned resilience and discipline. My dad always liked to remind us that our Japanese side descends from a line of samurai, so he taught us to be as strong as we can \u2013 both physically and mentally. And even though these are more rigid traits, we never forget to always put kindness and generosity at the forefront \u2013 be there to give a helping hand to others, treat others with respect, and stand up for what\u2019s right.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In light of the current events surrounding anti-Asian-related attacks, what is something you&#8217;d like others to be aware of?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think it\u2019s really important for others to know that unfortunately, these anti-Asian sentiments are nothing new &#8211; every generation has its share of stories of discrimination. My grandparents were redlined from buying a house in certain areas of Seattle, my Chinese grandfather had to wear an \u201cI am not a Jap\u201d button on his U.S. military uniform during WWII so he wouldn\u2019t be mistaken as a Japanese soldier, my parents have been called derogatory names\/told to go back to their countries, and my siblings and I have experienced many microaggressions \u2013 \u201cCan you see out of your eyes?\u201d \u201cJust be the quiet little Asian girl and don\u2019t speak.\u201d \u201cWhere are you from? No where are you <em>really<\/em> from?\u201d I think it\u2019s so important for others to know that in many Asian cultures, we\u2019re taught not to speak up, not to make a fuss or put our burdens on others and just ignore it. But because of the escalations in violence towards Asians that haven\u2019t gotten to this level in generations, we can no longer be silent about it.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We want our AAPI employees to feel safe and supported \u2013 how would you like allies to get involved?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think there are a couple of things allies can do in the immediate. The first is to have a moment of self-reflection \u2013 Have you ever cracked any Asian jokes? Have you made any sort of derogatory comments about our culture, someone\u2019s accent, our eyes, our food, etc.? Think about that. If you or a friend\/family member has, this is an opportunity to check yourself or check them. This may seem like a simple joke, but perpetuating these stereotypes has a domino effect in dehumanizing people and leading to further racism and violence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second way allies can get involved is to be aware when you\u2019re out in the community and there are other Asians around you. It\u2019s a scary time right now for the Asian community, and something as simple as riding the subway is nerve-wracking. I never leave my home now without my 4 self-defense weapons, and riding the subway or going to the store has become a stressful thing. So if you see someone sitting by themselves on the subway, try sitting next to them to provide a level of security. Or if you see someone being harassed, intervene if you think the situation won\u2019t turn dangerous. If you think it might, go up to the person after and just ask if they\u2019re okay &#8211; it will mean so much that you reached out. Maybe offer to walk them to their car or their subway stop so they feel a little safer. A single moment of reaching out to help makes a world of a difference.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image inline-img__margin-right\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Cassie.jpg\" alt=\"Cassie Chan Headshot\" class=\"wp-image-10105\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Cassie.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Cassie-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Cassie-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Cassie-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Cassie-200x200.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2>Cassie Chan<\/h2>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"subheading\">Performance Graphic Designer, AdParlor<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"subheading\"><strong>What led you to your current role at AdParlor?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Complete chance honestly \u2013 I was freelancing before I started at AdParlor and actually used a lot of their tools (shout out to the <a href=\"https:\/\/adparlor.com\/ad-mockups\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ad mockup generator<\/a>) in a lot of the jobs I took on.

In a way, being around people who don\u2019t look like me has reaffirmed that a large part of my identity stems from being Hong Kong-Canadian. When I was in high school, it used to be difficult discussing anything race-related considering that a majority of my school was very white and I could count on less than 2 hands the number of Asians (and, to an extent, people of color) who were in my grade. That experience had really shaped why I am very vocal about topics that affect racialized communities now.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In light of the current events surrounding anti-Asian-related attacks, what is something you&#8217;d like others to be aware of?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Marginalized communities face different and varied struggles, but we have a lot more in common with each other than we realize; for me in particular, I\u2019ve been reading up on the history of cross-racial solidarity in North America. During the Civil Rights Movement, Asian Americans were hugely influenced by Black leaders and communities in engaging with AsAm community education and self-reflection. Reading more about this made me realize our struggles are intersectional and fighting for liberation for one marginalized community also means fighting for liberation for all.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We want our AAPI employees to feel safe and supported \u2013 how would you like allies to get involved?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A really simple way is just checking in on your AAPI friends and coworkers and seeing how they\u2019re doing \u2013 it\u2019s been a tough while for us and everyone will deal with that differently. Ask if there\u2019s anything you can do to directly support them in the moment &#8211; like a distraction to take their mind off things or offer to buy them a meal. And as always, I encourage allies to seek resources and educate themselves on their own time; with activism and allyship, the work isn\u2019t ever &#8216;truly finished.&#8217; They\u2019re both based on a lifetime of accountability and learning and unlearning new information presented to you.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default inline-img__margin-right\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Alice.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Ly Headshot\" class=\"wp-image-10106\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Alice.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Alice-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Alice-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Alice-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Alice-200x200.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Alice Ly<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"subheading\">Sr. Manager, Branded Content, Fluent<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What led you to your current role at Fluent\/AdParlor?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was referred by Caleb K.

There are also those that still think &#8220;it can&#8217;t be <em>that<\/em> bad.&#8221; Only due to <em>some<\/em> media covering the attacks, it&#8217;s getting more attention. It\u2019s an unfamiliar spotlight for us but a necessary one. My parents told me they were screamed at while walking back home from the park, and my mom recently accompanied me to Downtown Los Angeles, later telling me she felt scared to be there. This is the reality that our parents and seniors are facing. They may not admit it, but internally they\u2019re shaken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those interested in learning more, I suggest following <a href=\"https:\/\/nextshark.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NextShark<\/a> (their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/nextshark\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IG page<\/a> is great too) to stay updated on Asian and Asian American news to see the bigger picture.

My fianc\u00e9, who is of Chinese descent, experienced an act of hate at the beginning of the pandemic. My initial reaction was pure anger &#8211; which I think is normal when someone you love experiences any act of hate or is threatened. However &#8211; after the hate subdued, I asked my fianc\u00e9 what I could do to help. She simply wanted me to listen to how she was feeling and understand this disgusting behavior against our Asian community is not new and has been going on for decades.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me personally, the upsurge in violence and increased coverage of hate against our Asian community have created a long list of emotions. Initially, I wanted to take action and do anything and everything in my power to help, but it took time and acknowledgment to realize that before I could make positive social change &#8211; I needed to be educated and purely listen first.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you liked this post and want to learn more from our team, check out the full Fluent Voices blog series <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/tag\/fluent-voices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a>. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fluent Voices is a blog series designed to give employees across all levels and departments within our organization the opportunity to share their unique stories and passions.
