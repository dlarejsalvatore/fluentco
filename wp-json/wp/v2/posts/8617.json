While we typically invite our interns into our NYC headquarters for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/resources\/fluent-internship\/\">summer of hands-on learning<\/a>, our approach to the program was a bit different this year. In the early planning stages, Evyn Chaffin, Senior Manager on the People Team and head of the internship program, had to address the challenges of coordinating a virtual internship experience amidst a pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The questions were abundant \u2013 Can we even hold the program this year? What will the experience be like for the interns? Their managers? How can we modify the program to help us better manage the remote experience?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In spite of all the uncertainty, one thing was sure \u2013 summer 2020 would present the unique opportunity to test the limits of creativity and connection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>\u201cThis year, in the middle of a pandemic, Evyn had to evaluate if we would be able to run the program, and if so, what changes needed to be made.

We crafted a robust two-week onboarding program that included best practices for using Zoom and navigating a remote work environment. At the end of this two-week period, we distributed a survey among the interns to help us gather real-time feedback and identify areas for improvement. For example, based on requests for a more collaborative workspace, we created Zoom \u201changouts\u201d so that the interns could work independently on their own projects while still video chatting with another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Creating a Sense of Community<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Each summer, we make every effort we can to fold the interns into our culture. This year, we needed to get creative with our approach to fostering a sense of community among the interns and within their individual teams. On a company-wide level, working from home has pushed us to find new ways to keep our employees engaged. After having already launched weekly meditation sessions and Rumble workout classes for the broader colleague-base, extending these benefits to our interns was a natural next step in making them feel part of the larger Fluent community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Supporting Professional Growth<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve also created specific initiatives for our interns to help aid in their personal and professional development. Weekly virtual sessions provide the interns with an opportunity to connect with senior leaders over Zoom, helping to make our executive team even more accessible than they would normally be in the office. In addition, we\u2019ve partnered with CareerArc to offer resume review services and mock-interview practice for up to 6 months after the end of the internship program. In this way, we hope to prepare our interns for the next steps in their career journey beyond Fluent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#00cfb5\">Stories &amp; Advice from Our Interns<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The program would not have been such a huge success without the hard work and cooperation of our amazing interns. Below, our 2020 Intern Class shares their stories, advice, and proudest accomplishments from the summer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What was the biggest challenge of being a remote intern? <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Giulia&nbsp;Rammairone | Customer Support Intern | Fordham University&nbsp;<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Giulia-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Giulia Rammairone Headshot\" class=\"wp-image-8618\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Giulia-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Giulia-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Giulia-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Giulia-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Giulia-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Giulia.jpg 1212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">One challenge I experienced in the beginning of my remote internship was to learn the complexity of Fluent\u2019s business model without ever meeting any of their employees in person. I was able to overcome this obstacle by doing ample research on the performance marketing industry as well as Fluent\u2019s owned and operated sites to learn how they leverage solutions to drive customer acquisition throughout various channels. Being eager to learn everything I could in such a short time, I often reached out to my colleagues to set up time to review any questions I may have had.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Proudest Accomplishment: <\/strong>I am most proud of the network I have built at Fluent. Although our internship was conducted remotely, I have made so many valuable connections with people I can hardly believe I have never met in person. It is so rewarding to know I am ending an internship with a group of people I can look up to and rely on in the upcoming stages of my career as a young professional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-green-cyan-background-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color is-style-dots\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chhavi&nbsp;Kumar | Data Science Intern | Stevens Institute&nbsp;of Technology<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Chhavi-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Chhavi Kumar Headshot\" class=\"wp-image-8646\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Chhavi-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Chhavi-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Chhavi-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Chhavi-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Chhavi-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Chhavi.jpg 1212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">As a remote intern, the initial few weeks were challenging. Understanding Fluent\u2019s business model and my team\u2019s role within it, comprehending the data I had to work with, and understanding my team\u2019s expectations of me all at the same was overwhelming. I felt I was almost always running short on time. As soon as I had this realization, I started putting in extra effort to help me get a head start for the next week. After practicing for a couple of weeks, I was soon on par with my daily tasks, and by the end of first month I was wheeling through assignments on schedule while enjoying the work I was doing.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Proudest accomplishment: <\/strong>As a Data Science Intern, I was asked to build a segmentation model to provide internal stakeholders with an understanding of the consumers completing offers, their attributes, and how those attributes interact and influence consumer behavior. As a student coming from an Information Systems major, with just a few relevant courses and academic projects, I applied for this role out of sheer passion and interest in the Data Science field. As I worked towards my deliverable for the internship, I really enjoyed working with data, choosing the course of the analysis, and making decisions independently \u2013 all factors that helped to reinforce my decision to choose career in this field. I am very proud of my entire journey as a Data Science intern as well as the end-product that I delivered. The model may not be the best of the best, but I have definitely put my heart and soul into building it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-vivid-green-cyan-background-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color is-style-dots\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elizabeth&nbsp;Fanshel | Product Intern | University of Illinois<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Liza-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Fanshel Headshot\" class=\"wp-image-8647\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Liza-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Liza-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Liza-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Liza-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Liza-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Liza.jpg 1212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Being on the product team, my role is traditionally very person-facing.

There are a lot of daily meetings and opportunities for collaboration. I try to be extra involved. For every meeting I\u2019m invited to, I am in, ready to contribute and participate, even if that means actively listening.

At the beginning of the internship I was not very knowledgeable about how promotional text messages are sent, the work that goes into sending these messages, and how to find out if these messages are successful. Thanks to my manager and my team I was able to learn about the SMS process and how to measure results. After doing market research and profitability reports I implemented my own SMS tests, which ended up earning more revenue than some of the previous messages.

Instead, the legal team was proactive in making sure I was included in everything they were working on \u2013 even if it was just to listen in on&nbsp;meetings \u2013 and&nbsp;gave me plenty of work to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Proudest Accomplishment:<\/strong> My favorite project during the internship involved researching international data privacy laws.

In an office environment, you get to interact with colleagues every day, but this is a challenge when it comes to a remote internship. In order to compensate for this, consider requesting a standing video meeting or a phone call to get to know people in different functions. I would also recommend connecting with peers and other professionals on LinkedIn to help build connections within the desired industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Proudest Accomplishment: <\/strong>In my Data Engineering internship, the team started migrating the data from a relational database to a Data Lake environment, which involved learning multiple components of AWS such as Glue, Athena, and S3.
