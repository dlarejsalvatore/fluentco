With that comes an expectation that their employers have a social and environmental stance on issues. For insight into Gen Z\u2019s perspective on corporate social responsibility, hear first-hand feedback from Devon Geelan, a panelist at Advertising Week New York and Marketing Manager at Fluent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>In\nyour opinion &#8211; how do you think Gen Z differs from the generations before you?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Our adolescence aligned with the\nrise of smartphones, making for information overload. Gen\nZ grew up reading compelling stories shared across the Internet in such a\nnative platform, it felt like activists and world leaders were speaking\ndirectly to us. I think this kind of digital social interaction is what makes\nus more cause-driven. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This information also leads us to be aware of advertising in a whole new way. Branding is more important than ever, in our own lives and for the companies, we buy from. I think we&#8217;re holding brands accountable and expecting more from them than past generations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What\nis your generation\u2019s responsibility to impact society? <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Each generation offers a unique\nperspective that enables social change. One of Gen Z&#8217;s major strengths is our\ninnate understanding of technology. It is our responsibility to help older\ngenerations better use these new tools and resources in meaningful ways. It is also\nimportant to consider volunteering at non-profits and other organizations that\nhave existed for hundreds of years to ensure they\u2019re informed on how they can\nuse technology to push their mission forward. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How do you live social good in your day-to-day life?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve become almost notorious in my\noffice for using reusable utensils, plates, and cups. In the grand scheme of\nthe issues facing our environment, it&#8217;s not making a huge impact. However, I\nthink when the masses start requesting alternatives, companies will have to\nmake changes, and those changes can make a huge difference. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What\ncompanies do a great job of giving back? <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/stories.toms.com\/\">Tom\u2019s<\/a> stands out to me as one of the first brands putting social good at the forefront of their business. Everyone I knew growing up was aware of their mission, to give a pair of shoes for every pair purchased. Today, many brands are emulating a similar model &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.warbyparker.com\/buy-a-pair-give-a-pair\">Warby Parker<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statebags.com\/pages\/about\">State<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/bombas.com\/pages\/giving-back\">Bombas <\/a>to name a few. For me, when comparing two similar products, I&#8217;m more excited to purchase the one that&#8217;s also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/resources\/marketing-generation-z-strategies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"giving back (opens in a new tab)\">giving back<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the buy one give one\nmodel, I know there are many companies that donate profit, use ethical\npractices, and are making strides in sustainability. I think there&#8217;s room in\nevery brand to add social good. There are plenty of profitable businesses that\naren&#8217;t innately &#8216;for good&#8217; but allocating budget to worthy causes can make\nemployees more motivated, consumers more engaged, and society better!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How\nimportant is authenticity to Gen Z and how do you decide if something isn\u2019t\nauthentic?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Inauthenticity can quickly\ncounter-act positive press. It is <em>always<\/em> good to donate money and time,\nbut if your company values and actions don\u2019t align our generation is quick to\ncall the bluff. For example, donating to organizations aiding the environment\nis wonderful, but if your company is responsible for significant pollution,\nthere is work that needs to be done within the organization itself to truly make\na change. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see this impacting the beauty\nindustry as well. Consumers in our generation feel like we know brands,\nincluding the personal brands of celebrities. Today, when choosing a brand ambassador,\nit&#8217;s important that the product aligns with their personal brand or consumers\nwon&#8217;t &#8216;buy&#8217; it. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Next year, Gen Z will represent almost a quarter of the workforce.
