In rural states like Iowa, Nebraska, and North Dakota, governors <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2020\/us\/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">held off on imposing stay-at-home orders<\/a> in favor of less severe restrictions.

As of today, more than a dozen states will have begun to partially reopen their economies and resume public life. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Texas is expected to take some of the most expansive measures, allowing retail stores, restaurants, movie theaters, and malls to reopen and operate at 25 percent capacity. Several states remain on extended lockdown, including California, New York, Illinois, and Michigan, where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/us\/live-news\/us-coronavirus-update-04-30-20\/h_e90047bd263620ce7d71d643aba02ed0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">armed protesters gathered at the Capitol<\/a> on Thursday to urge lawmakers to vote against extending the state of emergency.
