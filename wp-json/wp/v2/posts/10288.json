Did you expect to be where you are today? Where did you start, and how did you get to where you are now?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I started my first job in investment banking, I never expected to have a 25+ year career in marketing! I believe most successful careers come down to finding and pursuing your business passions. If you are passionate about something, your career will not be about a job or a role but about what you love doing. For me, I found my passion was about building and growing businesses. I got lucky to get into digital marketing at the right time and what a great industry to grow in!\u201d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Name a book or resource that has helped you grow in your professional life. What was the main lesson or takeaway?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI am sure most of Fluent and AdParlor are tired of me saying my favorite book is \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jimcollins.com\/article_topics\/articles\/good-to-great.html#articletop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Good to Great<\/a>\u201d by Jim Collins. The book is based on a lot of quantitative research and analytics around companies that have succeeded long-term compared to others that have not.\u00a0One of the main findings is that every successful company has a \u201cHedgehog.\u201d The Hedgehog concept is that you can build a great company and sustain it over time if you do three things well: chose something (1) you can be the best in the world at, (2) you are passionate about, and (3) that drives your economic engine (meaning you can make money). Simple and clear growth framework that can serve as a benchmark for a company, business unit, and department.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is one piece of career advice you\u2019d like to give to your younger self?\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe critical importance of focusing on relationships and how it is the foundation for long-term and consistent financial success.&nbsp;Too often, we are taught early in our careers&nbsp;to drive the financial numbers at all costs.&nbsp;And you can do that in the&nbsp;short term.&nbsp;But long-term, behind the financial numbers,&nbsp;are the people relationships \u2013 the ability to be direct, debate,&nbsp;and align on the right priorities. And support and encourage people on your team to develop and take risks.&nbsp;Strong relationships allow you to build high-performing teams that can put up extraordinary results.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image inline-img__margin-right\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Fluent-Voices-Roxanna.png\" alt=\"Career Advice - Roxanna Flores\" class=\"wp-image-10291\" width=\"250\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Roxanna Flores<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Senior Accountant, Fluent&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Name a book or resource that has helped you grow in your professional life.

People always say Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day and that resonates\u00a0with\u00a0every aspect of my life;\u00a0it is the brick-by-brick\u00a0building that has helped me become the person\/professional that I am today.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What skills\/qualities are necessary to be successful in your area of work?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Consistency:&nbsp;Being consistent helps build momentum and develops trust. The more&nbsp;consistent&nbsp;you are,&nbsp;the more&nbsp;people know what to expect from you both personally and professionally.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accountability: Owning up to your errors or mistakes is important for any field.

How did you develop this relationship and what impact has it had on your career?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cProfessionally one of my most impactful mentors is&nbsp;a former boss. When I first graduated&nbsp;college,&nbsp;I did not have a sense of where I was going yet and&nbsp;did not have the skills that I do now. In my first job,&nbsp;my&nbsp;boss became&nbsp;my mentor&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;he really took the time to help me grow my skills, pushed me to be a thinker, and taught me to be accountable. Personally,&nbsp;I also think&nbsp;my Fluent mentor is&nbsp;the bomb.com.&nbsp;He truly is such a likable individual&nbsp;and always super happy&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;every time&nbsp;I bring up his name&nbsp;people have nothing but great things to say about him and one day (when I grow up) I would love to be like him.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is one piece of career advice\u00a0you\u2019d\u00a0like to give to your younger self?<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI would tell myself not to be afraid of failure. Gowing up&nbsp;you are&nbsp;always&nbsp;told \u201cno&nbsp;you can\u2019t\u201d or \u201cyou failed\u201d but&nbsp;it is within those scenarios that you learn the most. The person you become is&nbsp;determined&nbsp;by&nbsp;perseverance, grit, and&nbsp;how you handle&nbsp;failures&nbsp;and step&nbsp;up to the challenges.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image inline-img__margin-right\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"260\" height=\"250\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Fluent-Voices-Tamim.png\" alt=\"Career Advice - Tamim Sangrar\" class=\"wp-image-10292\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Tamim&nbsp;Sangrar&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Product Manager, Mobile Apps, Fluent&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Think\u00a0back to\u00a0the beginning of\u00a0your\u00a0career.\u00a0Did you expect to be where you are today?\u00a0Where did you start, and how\u00a0did you get to where you are\u00a0now?\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a0<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not! It has been a dream journey so far\u2014a result of hard work, support, and blessings from the almighty. I started as a User Interface Developer only 3 years ago at Deloitte, took the plunge to pursue my master\u2019s degree in Management Information Systems, and dreamed of pursuing a career in technical product management. There were a lot of people that helped\u00a0shape\u00a0my journey both personally and professionally, most importantly my brother, mother, and sister provided constant support, along with my girlfriend and friends. All of them helped pick me up when I was down, motivated me, inspired me, and eventually led me to where I am right now.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is your biggest mentor?

Ever since I can remember,\u00a0he has been either my mentor or my inspiration, he has shaped me to become the person I am today both professionally and personally. Every major career decision that I have\u00a0made\u00a0has been either directly or indirectly influenced by him.
