Since then, the White House has struggled to formulate a strategic <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2019\/09\/30\/donald-trump-impeachment-staff-012914\" target=\"_blank\">impeachment response plan<\/a>. Denying the need for a war room and refusing appeals for outside counsel, Trump has instead taken his defense to Twitter, calling for the outing of the whistleblower, and demanding the House intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff be <a href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/national-security\/463723-schiff-becomes-key-democrat-in-battle-with-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">questioned for treason<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the impeachment process moves to the Senate, Democrats, who hold 47 seats, would need <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/what-is-impeachment-and-what-happens-next-if-president-trump-is-impeached\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">20 of the current 53 Republican<\/a> senators to agree with them on the charges to indict Trump.

In evaluating the grounds for impeachment, Americans are divided. 72% of Democrats, 36% of Republicans, and 45% of Independents believe that Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president warrants impeachment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the impeachment inquiry, the percentage of those who wish to see Trump re-elected in 2020 has remained steady over the course of this month. During the week of September 9, 32% of Americans wanted to see Trump re-elected; this week, that number has increased to 34%. Aides have used the impeachment inquiry as a tool for rallying support from Trump enthusiasts, releasing a 90-second <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2019\/10\/01\/trump-impeachment-campaign-014183\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">\u201ccounteroffensive ad\u201d<\/a> that brought in 50,000-plus new donors and raked in $8.5 million in two days.
