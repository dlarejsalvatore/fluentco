For brands looking to test the new IDs entering the market, a foundation of opted-in, first-party data will be key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in by first&nbsp;defining the different types of data&nbsp;&#8211; and exploring why first-party data&nbsp;will be&nbsp;so important&nbsp;to a brand\u2019s success in a post-cookie world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What\u2019s the&nbsp;Difference&nbsp;Between&nbsp;First,&nbsp;Second, and&nbsp;Third-Party&nbsp;Data?&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First-party data is collected and owned by a brand. First-party data is differentiating (because it is proprietary), relevant (because it relates directly to the brand), and reliable (because it comes straight from&nbsp;the source).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second-party data is collected, owned, and shared by a trusted partner.&nbsp;Second-party data partners help brands achieve scale by matching their behavioral data with syndicated audience segments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third-party data is collected via multiple sources, some of them unknown, and shared by an aggregator.&nbsp;While third-party data typically offers&nbsp;the most expansive reach,&nbsp;it&nbsp;can&nbsp;often&nbsp;be&nbsp;modeled or inferred, leading to inaccuracies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why is First-Party Data Collection So Important?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First-party data gives brands control over their marketing destiny by&nbsp;allowing them to build real and trusting relationships with consumers. As the relationship develops, brands can better understand consumer behavior, product preferences, insights, and buying signals over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By owning a first-party data set, a brand can also test addressable marketing campaigns across&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;channels without relying on third-party measurement. Finally, with first-party data,&nbsp;brands can increase efficiency and ROAS through&nbsp;true cross-channel optimization and attribution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Where and How to Collect First-Party Data<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the deprecation of third-party cookies on the horizon, brands are exploring new ways to collect opted-in&nbsp;consumer data.&nbsp;There isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all strategy when it comes to&nbsp;first-party&nbsp;data collection. While&nbsp;factors like scale and quality are important to consider,&nbsp;it&#8217;s crucial to prioritize transparency&nbsp;and trust when exploring the following acquisition channels:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Brand Website &amp; Owned Apps:&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand websites and owned apps can be considered the \u201cface\u201d of an organization. First-party data can be acquired through these channels via user registration, offers, promotions, contests, and online customer support. Some bene\ufb01ts include consumer-driven engagement, high accuracy, and privacy controls. Drawbacks might include limited access to scale and data attributes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Email Campaigns:&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Email campaigns&nbsp;enable brands to connect&nbsp;with vast audiences&nbsp;while also allowing for segmentation.&nbsp;Data that can be acquired through email campaigns include interest and intent. Some bene\ufb01ts of email campaigns&nbsp;include personalized engagement, transaction-based insights, and privacy controls. Cons include limited access to attributes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Social Media:&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media&nbsp;is a great way to reach new consumers and stay in touch with existing ones. Advertisers can leverage this channel to acquire polling data, customer support and feedback, and transactional data. Pros of social media may include consumer-driven engagement, ease of use, and low costs. Drawbacks include limited scale, di\ufb03culty gathering data, and broad data sets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">E-comm\/POS:&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An e-commerce platform manages inventory, customer accounts, shipping, and sales data.&nbsp;An example is transactional data. Bene\ufb01ts include large scale, accuracy, and strong behavioral data. Some drawbacks include di\ufb03culty giving notice to consumers and the anonymity of&nbsp;some purchase channels.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Data Append Partners:&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Data append partners \ufb01ll gaps in existing information such as contact information, email addresses, and more.&nbsp;Pros of data append partners include large scale and breadth. Disadvantages include high cost and lack of insight into consumer permission and accuracy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Consumer Engagement Platform:&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumer engagement platforms \u2013 like Fluent \u2013&nbsp;help brands collect<strong><em>&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong>self-declared insights&nbsp;directly from consumers.&nbsp;Some types of data that can be acquired through this channel include&nbsp;surveys, offers, promotions, interest and intent, and&nbsp;conquesting. Bene\ufb01ts include&nbsp;consumer-driven engagement, accuracy,&nbsp;fully-customized&nbsp;data collection, privacy controls, and large scale &#8211; though resources are required to partner&nbsp;effectively with a platform provider.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Download&nbsp;our full cheat sheet&nbsp;on the&nbsp;pros and cons of&nbsp;first-party data acquisition&nbsp;channels&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/info.fluentco.com\/hubfs\/Fluent%20Downloads%20-%20Blogs\/Fluent%20Cheat%20Sheet%20to%20First-Party%20Data%20Collection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>here<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong><em>.<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Future of&nbsp;First-Party&nbsp;Data Collection<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re entering a new era in which consumers have a lot more control over their privacy.
