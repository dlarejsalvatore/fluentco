My mom followed her passions through a variety of jobs, while my dad\u2019s been at the same craft for 40 years. Regardless of what they do, they lead with their heart, they find the fun, and always treat others with respect.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Name your current favorites:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Watching:<\/strong>&nbsp;Two queer-rooted reality competitions that maintain old traditions and push boundaries:&nbsp;Legendary and&nbsp;Rupaul\u2019s&nbsp;Drag Race.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Reading:<\/strong>&nbsp;Anyone else been obsessing over the news for the last 5 years?

It\u2019s a time to thank those who\u2019ve paved the way for equality before us, to mourn those we\u2019ve lost too soon, a time to love ourselves and appreciate our communities, and to continue to push back on senseless conformity. We\u2019ve come a long way, but there is so much work to be done to ensure we protect the most vulnerable in our society; regardless of their skin, how they identify,&nbsp;or who they love.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are there any Pride-related activities you\u2019ll be participating in this month that are especially meaningful in celebrating your identity?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For me,&nbsp;Pride has always been about connecting with my community. I\u2019ll be fortunate enough to celebrate with friends in person this year, but I\u2019ll also take the opportunity to contribute to local queer businesses,&nbsp;shops,&nbsp;and restaurants proudly owned by LGBTQ+ people.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m also excited to cheer on my friends at the finish line of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/bikerally.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PWA Friends for Life Bike Rally<\/a>; a six-day bike ride from Toronto all the way to Montreal to raise money for HIV\/ AIDS awareness and support.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do you think people can do this Pride Month to raise awareness about important issues that impact the LGBTQ+ community?<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think the biggest change of hearts and minds comes from the smallest conversations. When you hear a snide remark about someone\u2019s sexuality, or how they may present themselves, cut it at the source. Have those tough conversations with your parents, your extended family, with your kids about the strength of diversity. You never know who\u2019s listening, and what an impact it can make.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For bigger actions, you can donate to your local LGBTQ+ charities, make purchases at queer-owned businesses, and support legislation and politicians that protect gay and trans rights. It seems so simple, but these actions can and do save lives.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image inline-img__margin-right\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Fluent-Voices-Patrick.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Sweeney Headshot\" class=\"wp-image-10148\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Fluent-Voices-Patrick.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Fluent-Voices-Patrick-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Fluent-Voices-Patrick-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Fluent-Voices-Patrick-200x200.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2>Patrick Sweeney<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"subheading\">Head of People, Fluent<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What led you to your current role at Fluent?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was referred to Fluent, and once I met members of the team I would be working with, it was an easy decision to join!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model\/mentor\/career influence and why?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Years ago, I had a chance to work for two women; Lynze Ballay and Kate Lavender.&nbsp;They each&nbsp;played an&nbsp;equally&nbsp;important role in my development and advancement.&nbsp;Both were inspiring as they were powerhouses!&nbsp;They delivered results.&nbsp;They invested their time in building meaningful relationships.&nbsp; They saw a problem and&nbsp;fixed it&nbsp;&#8211; or&nbsp;empowered others around them to&nbsp;find a solution.&nbsp; Because of them, I was given a huge opportunity to help grow the business and expand the culture.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Name your current favorites:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Watching:<\/strong>&nbsp;Just finished Mare of&nbsp;Easttown and Legendary&#8230;started Hacks, any suggestions???&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Reading:<\/strong> For fun?&nbsp;Just started, &#8220;How Y&#8217;all Doing&#8221; by Leslie Jordan.<\/li><li><strong>Listening to:&nbsp;<\/strong>When listening to music, I&#8217;m on Spotify.&nbsp;It may be cliche, but I love all the PRIDE channels.&nbsp;It&#8217;s a fun POP blend of past and current&nbsp;music.<\/li><li><strong>Inspired by:<\/strong> My family.&nbsp;Whether it be my parents, sister,&nbsp;or niece and nephew, they continuously teach and challenge me.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What does Pride Month mean to you?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Pride is a special&nbsp;and&nbsp;important annual celebration.&nbsp;I remember being in the closet and seeing rainbow flags.&nbsp;I was so alone and craved to be a part of,&nbsp;and have&nbsp;a community.&nbsp;Over the years it has meant different things for me.&nbsp;It has been a time to come together and get more involved.&nbsp;It has been a time to create greater visibility for the community.&nbsp;And it has been an annual reminder to be proud, embrace&nbsp;my&nbsp;differences and the differences of others.
