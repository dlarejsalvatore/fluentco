Founded in 2008, Saha Global\u2019s mission is simple: provide clean drinking water to those who need it most. Based in Ghana, with offices in Tamale (HQ) and Salaga, Saha Global focuses on rural villages that depend on dugouts as their primary water supply. These dugouts are shared with local animals and livestock and can contain a high volume of bacteria. In just three weeks, Saha constructs water centers, often near the dugout, and employees 3-4 women entrepreneurs to run the business.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Dream-Grant-1-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Water center in Sillinboma\" class=\"wp-image-8165\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Dream-Grant-1-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Dream-Grant-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Dream-Grant-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Dream-Grant-1.jpg 1616w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Women entrepreneurs at a water center in Sillinboma<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What was your inspiration for this trip?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>My sister, Kate!

I was fortunate to spend four of those days out in the field with several members of Saha\u2019s research and implementation team. This meant early mornings, waking up around 5:00 am to beat the heat and travel out to the villages, taking anywhere from 1-2 hours by taxi. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My time in the field was split between two villages:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kalinka<\/strong> &#8211; a community with a Saha water center since 2013 (yes, over 6 years strong!). While there, I accompanied Mutala, a Saha R&amp;D team member, to help distribute new buckets for families. We visited a total of 28 households, reinforcing why Saha was there, and sharing best practices when using materials. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Dream-Grant-4-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Counting buckets in Kalinka\" class=\"wp-image-8173\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Dream-Grant-4-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Dream-Grant-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Dream-Grant-4-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Dream-Grant-4.jpg 1616w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Mutala counting new buckets within a household in Kalinka<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I returned two days later with Mutala and Kate for a re-opening of the water center in town.
