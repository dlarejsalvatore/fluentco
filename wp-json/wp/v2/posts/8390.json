They not only help us parents plan our own work schedules, but it is also scientifically proven that kids thrive on schedules. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide\" style=\"grid-template-columns:46% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"453\" height=\"605\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/WFH-3.jpg\" alt=\"Make a schedule\" class=\"wp-image-8391\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/WFH-3.jpg 453w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/WFH-3-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><strong>Take the time to sit down and think through a schedule that works for you and your family. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">There are a lot of examples online but you have to create something that works for your family so you\u2019ll stick to it. Remember, although our kids are physically at school for 7-8 hours a day, they\u2019re not sitting doing lessons the entire time. Fit in things like chores, free time, playtime, exercise, etc. so that the kids stay engaged and excited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Display the schedule in a place where everyone can see it.  <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My girls are always excited to know \u201cwhat\u2019s next\u201d and this allows them to mentally plan for the day or look forward to things like free time and lunch. <\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make the schedule familiar by empowering the kids to have a say in it.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, my first grader was having a hard time with the fact that I originally scheduled their Religion studies in the afternoon because \u201cReligion is right before lunch\u201d according to her (duh, Mom!). Switching things around so that it felt more familiar to their own school day helped a lot. We start each morning with their school prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance as well!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mimic your home routines of the regular school year. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep bedtimes and morning routines. We are not getting fully dressed each day, but we are changing out of PJs, making beds, brushing hair and teeth and eating a healthy breakfast with no morning TV &#8211; just like we would if the girls were headed off to their classrooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Preach progress over perfection<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are not going to follow the schedule perfectly every day. It\u2019s a really helpful guide and helps keep us stay as sane as possible, but giving ourselves the flexibility to call an audible to make room for something new will be key to overall happiness and sanity!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"285\" height=\"285\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Alyson-Headshots.png\" alt=\"Alyson Salva Headshot\" class=\"wp-image-8397\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Alyson-Headshots.png 285w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Alyson-Headshots-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Alyson-Headshots-100x100.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<h4 class=\"has-vivid-green-cyan-color has-text-color\">Stories<strong> &amp; Tips From:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Alyson Salva, Senior Account Director, AdParlor  <\/strong> <\/h4>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Create a designated workspace.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adhering to a normal school schedule as much as possible helps to maintain a sense of structure.  As much as we\u2019d all love to lounge in our jammies all day, it helps to get up and get changed into regular clothes before starting work-from-home\/home-school for the day.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular school started at 9 am, so the kids start virtual lesson plans at 9 am. We also set up a home-school station away from the television and other electronic distractions.
