Having been in a support role before, I always wanted to be a part of a product right from its inception. This required me to take a bold step to change my career and pursue a higher degree. My resilience to not settle in my comfort zone and my passion to bring a positive change around me helped in my journey. Fluent is a progressive place to work, providing immense growth opportunities, an inclusive work culture, and a nurturing environment.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model\/career influence and why?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy mother is my biggest role model. I have learned a lot from her growing up. Hard-working, resilient, and compassionate are some of the many adjectives that describe her. I remember two very important lessons that she taught my sister and me &#8211; First, it is of utmost importance for everyone to be financially independent, especially women. And second, one should never be hesitant to speak up when they believe that they are right.&nbsp;Both of these&nbsp;lessons have stayed with me ever since.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is one of your proudest&nbsp;career&nbsp;accomplishments?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI am really excited for where I am in my career right now. My journey from being a college graduate to having a prominent role in a data-driven environment and rapidly growing organization is something that I am proud of. Looking back, I am grateful for all the challenging situations that have tested me. I am proud of my pursuit to set up a strong process for myself that has helped me achieve my goals.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you\u2019d give to the next generation of women leaders?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOne of the most important things I\u2019d ask of every woman is to Speak Up! \u2013 Speak up for yourself, speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, speak up for equity and inclusion, speak up to challenge gender biases, and speak up for everything YOU believe in.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image inline-img__margin-right\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/fluent_voices_-_jess-copy.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Jeffers Headshot\" class=\"wp-image-10023\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/fluent_voices_-_jess-copy.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/fluent_voices_-_jess-copy-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/fluent_voices_-_jess-copy-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/fluent_voices_-_jess-copy-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/fluent_voices_-_jess-copy-200x200.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2>Jessica Jeffers<\/h2>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"subheading\">Senior Media Manager, AdParlor<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What led you to the role you&#8217;re in today?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>\u201cA LOT! I\u2019m originally from Manchester, UK, and after having lived in London for a few years, I started to get itchy feet and wanted to start a new chapter. I made the huge decision in 2019 to apply for a working holiday visa, pack my bags, and move across the pond to start a new adventure in Toronto! I\u2019ve had a couple of roles here, but my latest position at AdParlor was the result of wanting to move to the next stage of my career. I was so excited by the fact the Sr. Media Manager role was brand new, in a brand new division for AdParlor \u2013 the Performance Team &#8211; and I was thrilled by the prospect of growing something from the ground up. Today I can say we\u2019ve done\/are doing that!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model\/career influence and why?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy biggest role model is my mum! She moved countries from Ghana when she was in her early twenties too so I can relate to her on that level. She\u2019s in the medical profession and had to get used to a whole new culture, country, and train to be a midwife all at the same time. Both her and my dad have always been so supportive of me making the move to Canada and have  encouraged me to take risks&nbsp;and also&nbsp;enjoy the achievements and the special moments. They\u2019ve also taught me to embrace my ambitious nature and never to be afraid to throw myself out of my comfort zone.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is one of your proudest career accomplishments?&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fairly recent! The whole BLM movement last year was so poignant for me and I really took the time to assess where I am and how I feel. I\u2019m proud of how far I have come and representing my community in a senior position within such a diverse workplace. Being asked to participate in the Fluent Speaker Series \u201cBlack Lives Matter vs. All Lives Matter\u201d panel was a proud moment in my career because I was able to represent Black women&nbsp;in my workplace&nbsp;&#8211; and the reactions and responses from the team were so warm and loveable. It\u2019s also now taught me where I want to go from here &#8211; to achieve more and keep rising up.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you\u2019d give to the next generation of women leaders?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTo the next generation of&nbsp;women leaders,&nbsp;I would say, OWN your voice. No matter your background, culture, or who you are, you\u2019ve earned your right to take the stage and be heard. It took me some time to find mine when it comes to being in a work environment, but thanks to being surrounded by some very aspirational women in my career, I\u2019ve found it and run with it. I wouldn\u2019t be in the position I am today without having followed the advice I have been given along the way.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default inline-img__margin-right\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/fluent_voices_-_kerry-copy.jpg\" alt=\"Kerry Sorenson Headshot\" class=\"wp-image-10021\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/fluent_voices_-_kerry-copy.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/fluent_voices_-_kerry-copy-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/fluent_voices_-_kerry-copy-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/fluent_voices_-_kerry-copy-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/fluent_voices_-_kerry-copy-200x200.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Kerry Sorenson<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"subheading\">Director of Data Operations, Fluent<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What led you to the role you&#8217;re in today?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn college, I interned and eventually accepted a position as an account manager at a different lead gen company. In 2015, I was referred to Fluent by a former co-worker to become Fluent\u2019s second Data Account Manager.

I\u2019ve worked client-side and agency-side, always moving in a direction that would teach me something new. I was motivated by learning and that has taught me to work with the right people. I\u2019m forever a mentor and a mentee and I chose my current role because of the team \u2013 those who would be my leaders and inspire me, my colleagues,&nbsp;and the opportunity to help others navigate through challenges in the advertising world.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model\/career influence and why?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe foundation of my career has been built on working with strong women who took the time to coach me because they saw potential. Early in my career, I was in awe of Mary&nbsp;DePaoli&nbsp;(now EVP and CMO at RBC Bank) for being such a forward-thinking executive who worked her way on to the executive board at Sun Life Financial&nbsp;\u2013 a company&nbsp;where a&nbsp;CMO&nbsp;did&nbsp;not previously have&nbsp;a seat at the table. While she was my CMO at Sun Life, she gave me opportunities that inspired me and has&nbsp;continued to&nbsp;support me throughout my career when I\u2019ve needed it most. I strive to be the kind of women that inspires&nbsp;others, in the way that Mary inspired me.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is one of your proudest career accomplishments?<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;                        <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy proudest career accomplishment to date is seeing my former mentees excelling in new roles &#8211; women like Amanda Atkins (now Marketing Manager, Intuit) who was my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 while at&nbsp;GroupM. These talented women are now excelling in roles that didn\u2019t even exist 5 years ago and that makes me proud. Second to seeing the success of those I\u2019ve coached along the way, was launching my own consulting business in 2018. I was struggling with what to do next and launching my own business brought me back to the ground floor \u2013 building something from nothing. It was humbling, it was challenging, and while I may return to&nbsp;an&nbsp;entrepreneurial role&nbsp;someday,&nbsp;my role at&nbsp;AdParlor&nbsp;has allowed&nbsp;me to marry&nbsp;my&nbsp;love for building something from the ground up&nbsp;and&nbsp;inspiring talented&nbsp;young marketers to do great things!\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you\u2019d give to the next generation of women leaders?<\/strong>&nbsp;                                                                                                          <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFollow good people, and they will lift with you.
