Millennials tend to get a bad rap, from relying too heavily on technology to dodging their civic responsibility. Yet it\u2019s not so much that politics bore or disinterest Millennials. Rather, it takes rallying cries that appeal to their core values to prompt meaningful action.<\/p>\n<p>While young people have been involved in movements such&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/03\/25\/us\/march-for-our-lives-slacktivism-trnd\/index.html\">as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter<\/a>&nbsp;over the past decade, the recent March for Our Lives protest signaled a major shift. Calling for gun policy reform, Millennials and their younger counterparts are beginning to demand real change at the polls. In fact, by 2020,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sfchronicle.com\/opinion\/article\/Millennials-could-change-our-political-landscape-12667886.php\">Millennials are projected to supplant Baby Boomers<\/a>&nbsp;as the dominant generational voting group in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>32% of Millennials report following politics and 26% admit to caring a lot about who controls Congress. But only 12% contacted their representative in the past year. Millennials are disappointed in today\u2019s government, and yet still leaving opportunities to call for change on the table.&nbsp;How can we boost these numbers to ensure greater political engagement from Millennial voters and volunteers?<\/p>\n<p>It all starts with identifying the social issues that are most relevant to&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/fluentinc.wpengine.com\/insight\/disrupting-music-consumption\/\">Millennials<\/a>, and understanding the actions they take for these causes. Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind when mobilizing Millennials in support of your social movement or campaign:<\/p>\n<h2>Understand which Political Issues Millennials Care About<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re trying to reach Millennials, make sure that the cause you\u2019re promoting resonates with this target audience. Achieve\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.themillennialimpact.com\/\">Millennial Impact Report<\/a>&nbsp;examined Millennials\u2019 political and cause-related behaviors in the past year. According to this study, civil rights\/racial discrimination (29%), employment\/job creation (26%), and healthcare reform (26%) are the hot-button issues Millennials care about most today. External factors ranging from seasonality to current events influence the issues that rise to top of mind for Millennials. To stay relevant, advocacy groups should adjust their messaging to reflect an ever-changing news cycle and shifting national priorities. All while staying true to their organization\u2019s core mission and goals, of course.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7080\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.themillennialimpact.com\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-7080\" src=\"http:\/\/fluentcorp.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/politics-1.png\" alt=\"Millennials and Politics\" width=\"755\" height=\"426\"><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.themillennialimpact.com\/\">Millennial Impact Report<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fluentinc.wpengine.com\/insight\/disrupting-music-consumption\/\">Millennials<\/a>&nbsp;devote most of their attention to local causes and organizations, either independent of, or alongside, political participation on a national level. They will support causes that align with their core values, often overlooking party affiliation or institutional loyalty in favor of an opportunity to improve the lives of others.&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.themillennialimpact.com\/\">Nearly half (44%) of Millennials take social issue-related action because they are part of a group being treated unfairly<\/a>while a third act on behalf of a group they&nbsp;<em>observe<\/em>&nbsp;being mistreated.

However, this doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t believe in the government\u2019s ability to turn things around\u2014for the better. In fact, Millennials\u2019 concern with social issues most often translates into civic participation and further extends to grassroots efforts such as marches and rallies.<\/p>\n<p>Voting for political representatives with similar views, signing petitions, and posting\/sharing about causes on social media top the list of actions most frequently taken by&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/fluentinc.wpengine.com\/insight\/millennial-food-habits\/\">Millennials<\/a>.
