Now more than ever it is important for brands to practice empathy in addressing the struggles that many of their customers are facing during this uncertain time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, while Ibotta specializes in offering cashback on groceries and other household items, the company has had to acknowledge the ways in which grocery shopping habits have changed during the pandemic. Ibotta found that their core customers were shopping less frequently but making much larger shopping trips. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Lily-Gardner-Headshot-1.png\" alt=\"Lily Gardner Headshot\" class=\"wp-image-8591\" width=\"120\" height=\"120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Lily-Gardner-Headshot-1.png 511w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Lily-Gardner-Headshot-1-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Lily-Gardner-Headshot-1-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Lily-Gardner-Headshot-1-100x100.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>According to Lily, <em>\u201cWe\u2019ve had to pivot our message to make sure we\u2019re being sensitive to our audience\u2019s ability to go grocery shopping right now while also encouraging smart shopping habits like social distancing.\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than deploying new signup deals or welcomes bonuses, Ibotta has partnered with retail and CPG partners to launch campaigns that built credibility and trust with existing and new users. Lily referenced Ibotta\u2019s <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.ibotta.com\/featured\/ibotta-is-here-to-help-save-on-the-things-you-need\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cHere to Help\u201d<\/a> campaign which highlighted not only the value that Ibotta provides but also the value that the company\u2019s brand partners bring. According to Lily, \u201cThe co-branded message was really powerful and resonated well with our users.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the retail front, Drew and his team had to think outside the box in terms of new habits consumers were adopting while in quarantine. In shifting his strategy for an athletic retail client, Drew saw success with a new interest-based audience on Facebook\u2013 runners. According to Drew, &#8220;Because the gyms have been closed, more people were getting into walking and running than ever before. By introducing an audience that paired with that new activity, we saw a huge jump in our numbers.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tip #2 for Marketers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Focus your acquisition efforts on the channels where consumers are already actively engaged<\/strong>.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>At the start of the pandemic, Drew saw many of his clients shift their marketing dollars to their loyal customer base. Retargeting held steady, while prospecting saw a dip. Over time though, as more advertisers pulled back on spend, there was a surge in efficiency from a delivery standpoint for advertisers that were able to &#8220;keep the lights on.&#8221; According to Drew, brands that held steady in their marketing efforts were able to reach more consumers than they had before due to changes in the social advertising landscape. &nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ibotta has also had to reevaluate their user acquisition strategy during this time. The savings app company wanted to make sure their ad dollars were going to the channels that their users were already engaging with \u2013 TV, streaming, and social \u2013 while also leaning into affiliate partners to see how they could leverage their influencer and online content. Lily explained that once the team at Ibotta identified these channels, they had to shift their messaging to ensure they were reminding users how they could save money with their app during the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tip #3 for Marketers <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Launch new offerings to eliminate points of friction and make shoppers\u2019 lives easier<\/strong>.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The brands that have fared the best throughout the pandemic are those that were quickly able to adapt to the changing circumstances. Drew explains, \u201cOne of our home d\u00e9cor clients has a core customer base that is very used to shopping in-store. We saw a surge in performance when they launched a buy online and pick up on curb program, coupled with advertising investment behind the new service.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to make consumers feel more comfortable shopping in physical stores, brick and mortar locations have also begun offering contactless payment, reducing the number of customers allowed in the store, increasing sanitation on carts and entrances, and creating more safety barriers between employees and customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fluentpulse.com\/covid-19-shopping-habits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-07-15-at-1.23.25-PM-1024x438.png\" alt=\"Changes in Shopping Habits Charts\" class=\"wp-image-8596\" width=\"410\" height=\"176\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-07-15-at-1.23.25-PM-1024x438.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-07-15-at-1.23.25-PM-300x128.png 300w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-07-15-at-1.23.25-PM-768x328.png 768w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-07-15-at-1.23.25-PM-1536x657.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-07-15-at-1.23.25-PM.png 1778w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, while some shoppers are ready to return to stores, we found that <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/fluentpulse.com\/covid-19-shopping-habits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">27% of Americans expect to continue shopping more online<\/a> even after the pandemic subsides. This presents an important opportunity for brands to reduce points of friction that exist within their website, mobile app, and other touchpoints along the online shopping journey. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among his clients, Drew has seen a large uptick in the buy online, pick-up-on-curb offering, as well as free delivery options. Because many retailers are having trouble keeping up with inventory, they are also shipping from stores where they do have stock in order to speed up delivery times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ibotta is also making it easier for consumers to shop for groceries online either through the app or a new browser extension that is in the testing phase. According to Lily, \u201cOur research has shown that more and more people want to either get their groceries delivered or order ahead for curbside pickup.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Main Takeaways:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the start of this outbreak, Drew saw many advertising clients trying to predict how consumers would behave, and in most instances, those predictions could not have been farther from the truth. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Drew-Headshot-1.png\" alt=\"Drew Crawford Headshot\" class=\"wp-image-8595\" width=\"121\" height=\"117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Drew-Headshot-1.png 519w, https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Drew-Headshot-1-300x289.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 121px) 100vw, 121px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>According to Drew, <em>&#8220;It&#8217;s most important to let the data speak for itself. We all have assumptions but make sure to test and learn and listen to what consumers are actually doing, rather than what we assume they will do.&#8221;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2020 has been a year unlike any other. It is impossible to compare campaign performance or analyze year-over-year trends to measure success in this environment. Best advice according to Drew \u2013 come up with contingency plans to reallocate dollars and adjust expectations as we move into the second half of the year. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn how Fluent can help your company establish one-to-one relationships with consumers amidst this changing advertising landscape, drop us a line <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/lets-talk\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a>. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In our latest webinar, we sat down with marketing experts from Ibotta and AdParlor to discuss what brands can do to serve changing consumer needs and drive long-term loyalty during this uncertain time.
