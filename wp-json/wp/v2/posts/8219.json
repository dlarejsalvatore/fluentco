Can you speak to any particular new features or functions that you\u2019re excited about?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Today brands are more savvy. Brands have evolved from the earlier days of social where engagement and awareness initiatives played a prominent role in strategy, to a direct response, performance marketing approach. As a result of this shift, I\u2019ve noticed that paid social has become more and more sophisticated.&nbsp;Instead of focusing on generating purchases and direct returns, brands are now putting importance on maximizing Customer Life Time Value (CLTV) for net new and existing customers through loyalty programs. Currently, there are very few products and capabilities built around this within paid social, but I think this will change over the next year or so. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>&#8220;Instead of focusing on generating purchases and direct returns, brands are now putting a larger importance on maximizing Customer Life Time Value (CLTV) for net new and existing customers through loyalty programs.&#8221;<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>What platform features do retailers need to tap into to enhance and increase online shopping spend?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Time is money, literally. One of the most important platform features retailers need to tap into in order to enhance and increase online shopping spend is the checkout experience. Step one should be reducing the number of steps it would take for someone to complete a purchase. Leveraging learnings from some of the largest social platforms, brands need to find a way to pre-populate a majority of the user information that\u2019s normally filled out during the checkout process without requiring a user to sign-in to their customer profile (of course taking into consideration user privacy laws). Retailers can do this by accepting more payment methods beyond credit cards and PayPal (i.e. Apple Pay or Facebook Pay). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What is the best way to apply a personalized strategy to paid social in 2020?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/adparlor.com\/blog\/how-to-get-personal-with-your-social-campaigns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">personalized strategy<\/a> theoretically yields the best results. However, one thing I\u2019ve learned over the past few years, is that it is also possible to over-customize. In order to achieve efficiency and results, a strong personalized strategy is one that balances relevant and high-quality audiences. If your strategies have hit that sweet spot, an audience that\u2019s slightly larger but more qualified will yield better returns. This is because it is more cost-efficient to serve impressions to this audience vs. hyper-targeting a very small audience with higher delivery costs and overlapping creative iterations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn more about AdParlor&#8217;s advanced media buying capabilities <\/strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"here (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/adparlor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With 2019 coming to a close, we\u2019ve gathered insights from the experts at Fluent to understand the top digital marketing trends to expect in the new year.
