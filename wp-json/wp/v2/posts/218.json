A few weeks ago,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/fluentinc.wpengine.com\/insight\/hidden-job-market\/\">we released a report on the state of jobs<\/a>, specifically asking hourly-wage workers what kind of work they were looking for. Due to the low unemployment rate but the high number of people job seeking \u2013 almost a quarter of Americans \u2013 we concluded that Americans are painfully underemployed.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, economists have been keeping an eye out for signs that we are nearing a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/fivethirtyeight.com\/features\/the-job-market-is-having-a-goldilocks-moment\/\">\u201cfull employment\u201d economy<\/a>; when everyone who wants a job has one. The fear associated with this situation is rising wages due to competition. However, this isn\u2019t the case. Although the employers added 209,000 jobs in July 2017, employers still are not struggling to find workers. Wages have remained stagnant while the cost of living rises. While Americans are largely employed, it seems to indicate that these jobs are not making ends meet.<\/p>\n<p>To help you understand the state of the workforce, our amazing graphic designer created this comprehensive infographic.
