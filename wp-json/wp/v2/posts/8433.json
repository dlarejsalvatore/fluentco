Unlike the \u201908-\u201909 financial crisis in which traditional ad dollars began shifting online, digital ad dollars already represent over 50% of overall ad spend. This time around, the big shift will come from marketers reallocating ad dollars to more measurable channels. As marketing budgets shrink in the face of economic uncertainty, the pressure to drive a positive return on ad spend has never been more critical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4 Tips for Maximizing Your Return on Ad Spend<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. <strong>Reevaluate your objectives and define desired outcomes<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Now is a prime time for marketers to reassess the KPIs that matter most to their changing business objectives and identify cost-effective channels for achieving those goals. During a time of crisis, an awareness campaign that humanizes your brand can act as a valuable brand-building tool. If you\u2019re seeking to drive down-funnel actions, performance-based platforms and partners will help you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/resources\/performance-marketing-partnerships\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">de-risk ad spend<\/a> and get the most bang for your marketing buck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the IAB,&nbsp;34% of US agency and brand buy-side decision-makers plan to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.iab.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/IAB-COVID-19-Impact-on-Ad-Spend-Report-2_4.29.2020-FINAL.pdf\">increase their performance messaging strategy<\/a>&nbsp;as a direct result of COVID-19. While the marketing function has historically been viewed as a cost center, performance marketers are shifting the narrative to one focused on business growth. Held accountable for driving meaningful outcomes, performance marketers deliver against specific actions that ensure advertisers see positive ROI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. <strong>Move billable actions further down the marketing funnel<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, performance marketers have been moving away from top-of-funnel conversions, like clicks and installs, towards \u201cdeeper funnel\u201d billable actions, like a sale or paying customer. This shift in mindset is bringing the potential of performance partnerships to the forefront. Advertisers are realizing that performance is about driving strong lifetime value and customer loyalty, not just fulfilling short-term goals. Even as marketing budgets shrink in the face of economic uncertainty, performance marketing remains a reliable channel for driving customer acquisition and overall growth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the billable action is moved further down the funnel, there is less focus on short-term wins and more opportunity to grow long-lasting partnerships. Transparency across advertisers, publishers, and enablement partners are key for growing strategic performance partnerships that drive measurable results. Advertisers should be willing to share proprietary performance data to identify which consumer cohorts are converting and help publishers optimize toward quality, scale, and customer lifetime value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. <strong>Implement reliable mechanisms for measurement and tracking<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With brands cutting, pausing, and shifting ad spend, measurement and tracking are non-negotiable in helping marketers to prove out the value of their investments. Attribution is often an issue for traditional channels like linear TV, and digital channels measured on clicks and impressions do little to reveal the actual impact of dollars spent. For advertisers seeking to drive and measure meaningful outcomes, performance marketing partnerships allow for real-time tracking across channels and devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advertisers can leverage performance partnerships to connect with consumers during the discovery and awareness phase, when they\u2019re making a purchase, and after the point of conversion for ongoing customer engagement. An entire ecosystem of performance-oriented, measurement platforms has emerged over the past five years, making the adoption of a performance-first approach far easier to implement than the period following the last major crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>4. <strong>Develop programs for driving loyalty and long-term value<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Advertisers are no longer looking at performance marketing efforts as an opportunity to monetize immediately, but rather as a channel to establish direct relationships with customers. A key benefit of that relationship is gaining access to first-party data and leveraging these insights to support long-term personalization and CRM marketing efforts. Insights into purchase decisions and down-funnel actions are invaluable in identifying and responding to consumers\u2019 needs no matter where they are in the customer journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While consumer spending across categories may be down, this is a great time to launch a loyalty program to build relationships and remind consumers that your brand will be there when they\u2019re ready to engage. With consumers spending more time on their mobile devices than ever before, SMS and push notifications will also become important tools for re-engaging customers with relevant messaging. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Looking Ahead<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For brands striving to maintain relevance during this period, the notion of \u201ccustomer-centricity\u201d is crucial. As performance marketing practices continue to evolve, advertisers will need to look \u2018beyond the banner\u2019 to connect consumers with the products and services that provide real value, foster brand loyalty, and ultimately maximize your return on ad spend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was originally published on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mediapost.com\/publications\/article\/352135\/maximizing-return-on-shifting-pandemic-era-ad-budg.html?edition=118617\" target=\"_blank\">MediaPost<\/a>. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As marketers reallocate ad dollars to more measurable channels, the pressure to drive a positive return on ad spend has never been more critical.
