Start-ups rise and fall in the blink of an eye, dependent on tough investors and needs that can outlast trends. In this new era of technological revolution, a few top tech companies stand above the crowd: Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, these four were ranked by Americans as the most likely to be around in 50 years, with Google standing at 33% likelihood, followed closely by Amazon, then Apple and Facebook. Google was named the most necessary of the top tech companies, with 41% of Americans saying it would be the hardest to live without.<\/p>\n<h2>Achieving Indispensability: Top Tech Companies (We Think) We Can\u2019t Live Without<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s offerings are diverse \u2013 everything from AdWords and Maps to Google Drive, Chromecast, and Pixel Phones \u2013 however,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/stock-analysis\/2012\/what-does-google-actually-make-money-from-goog1121.aspx\">over 90% of their revenue comes from one source<\/a>: pay per click advertising. Though most people use a Google product every day, either running a search on the engine (65%), checking their Gmail (63%), finding directions via Google Maps (57%), these venues are unfortunately not profitable for this top tech company. If PPC advertising was suddenly eliminated or cheapened, this top tech company, as well as Facebook, would need to find a new way to make money, fast. Even if this were the case, no challenge is too large for a company with a product so valuable, it was turned into a verb.<\/p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"288\">Which of these companies do you think are most likely to exist in 50 years?<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"102\">Total US<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"108\">Age 18-34<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"126\">Age 35+<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"288\">Google<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"102\">33%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"108\">38%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"126\">31%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"288\">Amazon<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"102\">29%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"108\">24%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"126\">31%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"288\">Apple<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"102\">21%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"108\">23%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"126\">21%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"288\">Facebook<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"102\">17%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"108\">15%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"126\">17%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Amazon similarly has diverse offerings in its online marketplace, expanding into food delivery and phone manufacturing.
