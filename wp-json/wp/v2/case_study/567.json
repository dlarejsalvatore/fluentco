Members of the book club receive a personalized package approximately every three weeks that is filled with two or three new books that are expertly curated for their child based on age. The company has aggressive subscription growth goals and places an emphasis on not just driving volume but high lifetime subscriber value. To achieve this, Sandvik has had a long term partnership with Fluent and has seen tremendous success driving online subscriptions at scale to exceed its business objectives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Campaign<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluent has been directly driving quality online subscriptions for Sandvik since April 2016 and has the capability to make up as much as 25% of the overall media mix. Over this time, Fluent has driven reliable and steady growth.\u00a0 Utilizing its proprietary survey platform, Fluent is able to identify not only parents but also those with a self-declared interest in joining an online book club. These pre-qualified prospects are then served an ad for a Sandvik book club within Fluent\u2019s proprietary media network. Built on a performance model, Sandvik pays only for down the funnel activity when an order form is complete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cSandvik puts particular emphasis on lifetime value, a metric that we track with a proprietary system, and<strong>\u00a0Fluent consistently drives quality subscriptions<\/strong>\u00a0that meet this internal KPI.\u201d <span class=\"whosaidit\">&#8211; Lauren Ball, Director, Acquisition Marketing, Sandvik Publishing<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Results<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>This campaign has increasingly driven the majority of new subscriptions as compared to other partners. Over the course of the partnership, Fluent has seen 750% growth in the order volume. Additionally, Fluent outperforms email partners who email on behalf of Sandvik and drives better lifetime value, a metric that the company meticulously tracks. The most important campaign Key Performance Indicator is subscriber lifetime value and Fluent consistently satisfies this metric for success. Fluent successfully delivers not only quality subscribers but is also able to scale to meet the evolving needs of the campaign. Recently, Fluent surpassed Facebook as the top volume driver. Working together on a cost per acquisition model, Fluent continues to be one of Sandvik\u2019s key partners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"hubSpot_buttonContainer hubSpot_caseStudy_button\">\n\t<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-28ef1388-bee9-478f-b229-94a0e8859edf\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-28ef1388-bee9-478f-b229-94a0e8859edf\" id=\"hs-cta-28ef1388-bee9-478f-b229-94a0e8859edf\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/455243\/28ef1388-bee9-478f-b229-94a0e8859edf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-28ef1388-bee9-478f-b229-94a0e8859edf\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/no-cache.hubspot.com\/cta\/default\/455243\/28ef1388-bee9-478f-b229-94a0e8859edf.png\" alt=\"Download the PDF\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(455243, '28ef1388-bee9-478f-b229-94a0e8859edf', {}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n<\/div>\n<br>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sandvik has had a long term partnership with Fluent and has seen tremendous success driving online subscriptions at scale to exceed its business objectives. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/case-study\/sandvik-publishing\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":574,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[140],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/case_study\/567"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/case_study"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/case_study"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/574"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=567"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=567"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=567"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
