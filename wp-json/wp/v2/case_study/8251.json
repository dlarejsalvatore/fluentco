Partnering with over 1,500 brands and retailers, Ibotta helps users earn cash back when they shop online, complete a receipt upload, link a loyalty account, or leverage the app\u2019s \u201cPay with Ibotta\u201d mobile pay feature. As a growing brand, Ibotta sought a strategic \u2013 and scalable \u2013 partnership that could drive high LTV users at a competitive CPA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Campaign<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>To help Ibotta achieve its growth goals, Fluent launched a campaign on The Smart Wallet (TSW), an owned and operated content site within its portfolio of digital properties. As a trusted media brand designed to help consumers discover new ways to earn, win, and save money, TSW was a perfect fit from an audience alignment perspective. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluent created custom content pieces to highlight Ibotta\u2019s value proposition and drive awareness around new features. Performing rigorous testing, Fluent made campaign optimizations based on findings from top-performing copy, creative, and content formats. Identifying the messaging that resonated best with their audience, Ibotta also applied these insights to their overall marketing strategy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluent closely monitored the success of the campaign using a seamless integration with AppsFlyer, a leading mobile app tracking and attribution platform. Offering full transparency into performance, Fluent was able to track and report on the full user experience, including post-conversion events beyond the initial receipt upload or mobile commerce purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;Since launch, Fluent has truly been an extension of our team. We\u2019ve done extensive work testing, optimizing, and strategizing with Fluent to identify the best ways to drive efficient user acquisition for our app. We value Fluent\u2019s proactive approach to sharing learnings with our team and trust in their ability to drive consistent results.&#8221; &#8211; Matt Rome, Sr. Marketing Associate, Customer Acquisition at Ibotta<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Results<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluent has reduced Ibotta\u2019s cost per acquisition by 51% year-over-year, enabling Ibotta to scale their UA campaign and double spend since launching in November 2018. Insights gathered from A\/B testing provide added value to the partnership, informing Ibotta\u2019s cross-channel media strategy and helping them to gain a better understanding of their target audience. Fluent continues to drive impressive activation rates and user quality, leveraging performance data to scale their highest performing content and improve the overall consumer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"hubSpot_buttonContainer hubSpot_caseStudy_button\">\n\t<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-1f0ee942-f60a-4358-9f1a-439f99e08440\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-1f0ee942-f60a-4358-9f1a-439f99e08440\" id=\"hs-cta-1f0ee942-f60a-4358-9f1a-439f99e08440\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/455243\/1f0ee942-f60a-4358-9f1a-439f99e08440\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-1f0ee942-f60a-4358-9f1a-439f99e08440\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/no-cache.hubspot.com\/cta\/default\/455243\/1f0ee942-f60a-4358-9f1a-439f99e08440.png\" alt=\"Download the PDF\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(455243, '1f0ee942-f60a-4358-9f1a-439f99e08440', {}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ibotta sought a strategic partnership that could drive high LTV users at a competitive CPA.
