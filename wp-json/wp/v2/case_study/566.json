In 2017, the company saw the opportunity to partner with Fluent to continue scaling and growing its customer base by engaging new shoppers for its in-store and online sales channels. Even with a large digital customer base built through organic programs, Finish Line needed to reinvigorate current users to make more purchases and also add new subscribers to its database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Campaign<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Leveraging Fluent\u2019s acquisition solution, Finish line grew its CRM database substantially. Fluent identified and pre-qualified consumers who were most likely to opt in to Finish Line\u2019s loyalty programs and make repeat purchases. By monitoring performance closely and ingesting feedback on subscriber engagement, Fluent was able to consistently optimize the campaign and drive higher volume and sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cFluent has been an incredible partner, helping us increase both our ecommerce and in-store sales. 20% of our customers that we\u2019ve identified through Fluent campaigns have joined our loyalty programs and\u00a0<strong>33% have made repeat purchases with us<\/strong>\u00a0throughout the year. We\u2019ve enhanced our customer lifecycle and our share of wallet substantially since working with Fluent.\u201d &#8211; Reed Pankratz, Sr. Digital Strategist at Finish Line<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Results<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Finish Line grew its CRM database significantly in just 3 months. More importantly, over the course of a 12 month period, revenue generated per customer, from both online and in-store sales, was 10X the initial investment in the program. Beyond just increasing the total number of customers in their database, the company wanted to increase loyalty and drive repeat purchases \u2013 and it achieved that goal. 33% of customers acquired through Fluent campaigns made repeat purchases throughout the course of the year, and 20% joined Finish Line\u2019s loyalty programs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"hubSpot_buttonContainer hubSpot_caseStudy_button\">\n\t<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-fb0ac180-6a12-49a5-bcbb-fa13f7250b01\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-fb0ac180-6a12-49a5-bcbb-fa13f7250b01\" id=\"hs-cta-fb0ac180-6a12-49a5-bcbb-fa13f7250b01\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/455243\/fb0ac180-6a12-49a5-bcbb-fa13f7250b01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-fb0ac180-6a12-49a5-bcbb-fa13f7250b01\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/no-cache.hubspot.com\/cta\/default\/455243\/fb0ac180-6a12-49a5-bcbb-fa13f7250b01.png\" alt=\"Download the PDF\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(455243, 'fb0ac180-6a12-49a5-bcbb-fa13f7250b01', {}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n<\/div>\n<br>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finish Line partnered with Fluent to continue scaling and growing its customer base by engaging new shoppers for its in-store and online sales channels.   <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/case-study\/finish-line\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":571,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[142,172],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/case_study\/566"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/case_study"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/case_study"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/571"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=566"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=566"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.fluentco.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=566"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
