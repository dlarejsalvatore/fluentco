The company operates more than 400 stores in 33 states and Puerto Rico, and offers online shopping at ShoeCarnival.com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoe Carnival wanted to rapidly grow enrollment in its loyalty program, as well as increase the size of its email subscriber list. Shoe Carnival saw great results when they made signups easier at the POS in-store, and wanted to extend that reach online. The goal was to accelerate growth beyond the walls of its own website, without sacrificing its strong organic user engagement metrics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Campaign<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoe Carnival teamed up with Fluent to run performance-based online and mobile ads which promoted enrollment in its Shoe Perks loyalty program. Leveraging the Fluent platform\u2019s ability to ingest existing \u201cmost valuable customer\u201d profile information, Shoe Carnival was able to target lookalikes of its best customers for acquisition, and also optimize its acquisition campaign in perpetuity based on ongoing performance analytics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cTypically,\u00a0<strong>consumer engagement with email prospecting is lower than with retention-based mailings, but we didn\u2019t see that with Fluent.<\/strong>\u00a0Engagement has been just as high, and in some cases, even higher, than with our standard campaigns.\u201d &#8211; Michael Nuss, eCommerce Marketing Manager at Shoe Carnival<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Results<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoe Carnival rapidly grew its loyalty program membership and email database without sacrificing revenue per subscriber. In comparison with its organic efforts, click-to-open rates on welcome messages for Fluent-generated sign-ups were 13% higher than sign-ups through the website, and bounce rates were negligible (and also lower than on-site sign-ups).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"hubSpot_buttonContainer hubSpot_caseStudy_button\">\n\t<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-c7299599-dd30-4804-a12a-45abbcb8bc5e\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-c7299599-dd30-4804-a12a-45abbcb8bc5e\" id=\"hs-cta-c7299599-dd30-4804-a12a-45abbcb8bc5e\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/455243\/c7299599-dd30-4804-a12a-45abbcb8bc5e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-c7299599-dd30-4804-a12a-45abbcb8bc5e\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/no-cache.hubspot.com\/cta\/default\/455243\/c7299599-dd30-4804-a12a-45abbcb8bc5e.png\" alt=\"Download the PDF\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(455243, 'c7299599-dd30-4804-a12a-45abbcb8bc5e', {}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n<\/div>\n<br>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Background Shoe Carnival is one of the nation\u2019s largest family footwear retailers, offering a broad assortment of moderately priced dress, casual and athletic footwear for men, women and children with emphasis on national and regional name brands.
