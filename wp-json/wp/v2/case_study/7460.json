Aiming to flip the House in the 2018 midterm elections, the DCCC partnered with Fluent in mid-2016. Our team was tasked with driving email signups of users with a high propensity to donate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Campaign<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The DCCC builds their email list with passionate Democrats and progressives willing to donate. Based on proprietary consumer insights, Fluent ran an email acquisition campaign targeting self-declared Democrats and progressives with an interest in donating to causes or candidates. Our team quickly generated positive ROI, enabling the DCCC to invest in key races.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cEarly email list growth is a winning strategy for political campaigns and organizations. We leveraged Fluent to tap into inventory we could not have accessed elsewhere. They proved to be a go-to outlet because of the quality and scale of new-to-list email addresses. And the results paid off for us and our Democratic majority in Congress.\u201d &#8211; Ryan Thompson, Chief Digital Officer, DCCC<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Results<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The acquisition campaign launched smoothly, due to seamless communication and targeting optimization based on the DCCC\u2019s conversion data. This resulted in a 341% ROI on November 2016 through March 2017 early investment phase and 170% ROI on January 2017 through November 2018 cycle-long collaboration, allowing for investment in over 80 races throughout the midterm<br>\nelections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the addition of over 150,000 new grassroots donors, the DCCC successfully contributed to the election of 40 Democrats in the midterm elections and turned the House blue. Since the beginning of the partnership, Fluent connected the DCCC with supporters who have raised over $10 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"hubSpot_buttonContainer hubSpot_caseStudy_button\">\n\t<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-560fb069-9ca5-45fe-aa51-b03c882f84e3\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-560fb069-9ca5-45fe-aa51-b03c882f84e3\" id=\"hs-cta-560fb069-9ca5-45fe-aa51-b03c882f84e3\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/455243\/560fb069-9ca5-45fe-aa51-b03c882f84e3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-560fb069-9ca5-45fe-aa51-b03c882f84e3\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/no-cache.hubspot.com\/cta\/default\/455243\/560fb069-9ca5-45fe-aa51-b03c882f84e3.png\" alt=\"Download the PDF\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(455243, '560fb069-9ca5-45fe-aa51-b03c882f84e3', {}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n<\/div>\n<br>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Aiming to flip the House in the 2018 midterm elections, the DCCC partnered with Fluent in mid-2016.
