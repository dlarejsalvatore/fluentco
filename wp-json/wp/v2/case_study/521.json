They wanted to increase the number of travel deals sourced directly through its website by acquiring a significant volume of new, highly engaged email subscribers. The company also knew that its best customers were women aged 35 and older who live in metropolitan areas, and who had indicated a desire to travel within the next 6 months, so it wanted to focus its efforts on this pre-defined ideal customer profile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Campaign<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheapflights.com partnered with Fluent to acquire its ideal customers while ensuring high engagement and campaign ROI. Fluent leveraged its real-time interactions to pre-qualify registrants based on age, gender, location, and travel intent before serving precision-targeted email opt-in ads for Cheapflights.com across its expansive digital advertising network. Fluent then applied automated lookalike modeling in order to rapidly ramp up the volume of qualified signups that were generated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cFluent\u2019s<strong>\u00a0intelligent ad targeting<\/strong>\u00a0and ability to drive large numbers of qualified subscribers has made them one of our most important partners.\u201d &#8211; Yogesh Sharma, Global Head of Newsletters at CheapFlights<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Results<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Opt-ins generated for Cheapflights.com outperformed the company\u2019s next best acquisition partner by 10% when it came to conversions, and drove 95% more volume of new subscribers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"hubSpot_buttonContainer hubSpot_caseStudy_button\">\n\t<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-7f1d90ef-7d0c-460e-94e4-ba5856e3c526\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-7f1d90ef-7d0c-460e-94e4-ba5856e3c526\" id=\"hs-cta-7f1d90ef-7d0c-460e-94e4-ba5856e3c526\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"><\/div><![endif]--><a href=\"https:\/\/cta-redirect.hubspot.com\/cta\/redirect\/455243\/7f1d90ef-7d0c-460e-94e4-ba5856e3c526\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-7f1d90ef-7d0c-460e-94e4-ba5856e3c526\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/no-cache.hubspot.com\/cta\/default\/455243\/7f1d90ef-7d0c-460e-94e4-ba5856e3c526.png\" alt=\"Download the PDF\"><\/a><\/span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/js.hscta.net\/cta\/current.js\"><\/script><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> hbspt.cta.load(455243, '7f1d90ef-7d0c-460e-94e4-ba5856e3c526', {}); <\/script><\/span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n<\/div>\n<br>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Background Cheapflights.com is the original travel search engine and flight comparison site, and offers an ideal alternative for travelers who are flexible with their travel dates and are looking for the best overall deals.
