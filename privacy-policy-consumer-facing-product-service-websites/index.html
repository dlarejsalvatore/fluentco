<p><strong>RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA USERS WITH REGARD TO THEIR INFORMATION</strong><br><br>California users have several rights regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and sale of their information under the CCPA. One of these rights, notice of collection of Information, is described above; the balance of these rights are described below and include the following rights:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Disclosure of information collected and sold</li><li>Opt-out from the sale of Information</li><li>Deletion of Information</li><li>Access and portability of Information collected</li><li>Non-discrimination</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Exercising Your Rights, Verification, and Timing.</strong> To exercise your CCPA rights, click on the “<a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/42194476-4013-4c77-ba0d-3040a55b20f2/f0da368d-3cb1-4430-b390-61759fc40282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do Not Sell My Personal Info</a>” link on the bottom of our Website pages where we collect Information, or send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@fluentco.com">privacy@fluentco.com</a>. To prevent an unauthorized third party from accessing or making decisions regarding a user’s Information, we verify all requests to exercise these rights (a verifiable consumer request). We do not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or abusive.<br><br>In general, we will verify a request by matching the identifying information supplied by the user with the Information we already have for the user. If we cannot verify the user using the foregoing method, we may request additional information, which we will not retain or use for any other purpose.<br><br>For all verifiable consumer requests, we strive to respond within forty-five (45) days of receipt. If we require additional time, which can be up to ninety (90) days in the aggregate, we will provide written notice. Any disclosures we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt and will be delivered electronically in a secure fashion. If, for some reason, we cannot fulfill or comply with your request, our response will explain that decision. <br><br><strong>Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold.</strong> While users have the right to request different levels of disclosure regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and sale of Information, we have elected to treat all requests from California residents as an exercise of expanded disclosure requests by businesses that sell Information. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you for the 12 months prior to your request:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The categories and sources of Information collected;</li><li>Our business and commercial purposes for collecting and selling that Information;</li><li>The categories of third parties with whom we shared that Information;</li><li>The specific pieces of Information collected;</li><li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, we will disclose:</li><li>For sales - the Information categories for each category sold and the categories of third parties to whom the Information was sold; and</li><li>For disclosures - the Information categories for each category disclosed and the categories of third parties to whom the Information was disclosed.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Right to Opt-Out. </strong>Users have the right to opt-out from the sale of their Information. We provide a “Do Not Sell My Personal Info” link on each Website page where we collect Information that links to an online request form. You can access the form <a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/42194476-4013-4c77-ba0d-3040a55b20f2/f0da368d-3cb1-4430-b390-61759fc40282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> or you can send an email to <a href="mailto:help@myprivacyrequest.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy@fluentco.com</a> and elect to opt-out from the sale of your Information.  We reserve the right to verify all opt-out requests using the methods described above. <br><br>While our agreements with third parties to whom we sell or disclose Information prohibit the further sale or use beyond the scope of our agreement with them, if a California user opts-out, we will notify all third parties to whom we have sold or disclosed the California user’s Information within the previous 90 days and remind them not to further sell the Information. We will not ask a California user who has opted out to re-opt-in for one year after the California user opts-out. If the user requests a transaction with us that requires the sale of their Information, we will inform them that they have opted out and if they want to proceed with the transaction, we will offer the opportunity to opt-in by completing a two-step process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Deletion of Information</strong>. You have the right to request that we delete any of your Information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request using the process set forth above, we will delete or deidentify (and direct our service providers, vendors, and other applicable third parties to delete) your Information from our system other than from our archive servers (which we maintain for compliance purposes), unless there is an applicable exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We may decline to process your deletion request if the Information is necessary for us or our service providers, vendors, or other applicable third parties for a number of reasons. For example, we may decline your deletion request if the Information is required to Complete the transaction for which we collected the Information or provide the goods or services you requested;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} -->
<ol type="1"><li>Detect security incidents, protect, investigate and respond to malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;</li><li>Identify and correct errors that negatively impact intended functionality; and</li><li>Comply with a legal obligation, including Federal and/or State tax liability and reporting.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we do not comply with a deletion request, we will provide the grounds for our denial.<br><br><strong>Access and Portability.&nbsp;</strong>California users have the right to access the Information we have collected about them in the previous twelve (12) months. Upon receipt of verified consumer request, we will provide the information in a readily usable format. You cannot request access more than twice in any 12-month period.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Nondiscrimination.</strong>&nbsp;We are committed not to discriminate against California users who exercise their CCPA rights. As such, unless otherwise permitted by the CCPA, we will not deny, charge you different prices or rates, or provide a different quality level of goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties, and/or suggest that you may receive a different price, rate, or quality level of goods or services. While we do not provide financial incentives for users who do not exercise their CCPA rights, please note that some of the functionality of the Website may be unavailable if consumers exercise their rights to have their personal information deleted.<br><br><strong>Authorized Agent.</strong>&nbsp;The CCPA enables California users to appoint an authorized agent to act on their behalf to submit disclosure requests and or deletion requests under the CCPA. The authorized agent must register with the California Secretary of State. We will honor a request from an authorized agent provided you provide written authorization to the authorized agent to act on your behalf and we can verify your identity and the agent submits proof of authorization.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>CCPA Metrics.&nbsp;</strong>We are required to compile certain annual metrics regarding the CPPA including the number of disclosure, deletion and opt-out requests we receive, the median number of days it takes us to respond, and how many of each were denied. The metrics for the period of 1/1/2020 from 12/31/2020 are displayed below. Please note that the information outlined below is compiled from various entities, which include our parent, subsidiaries, and other entities under common control with us.</p>

<p><strong>CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT</strong><br><br><strong>Shine the Light Rights.</strong>&nbsp;In addition to the CCPA-mandated disclosures described above, the California Online Privacy Protect Act (“CalOPPA”) contains a Shine the Light section that permits users who are California residents to request information regarding our disclosure of their Information to third parties, including the categories of Information shared and a list of the names and addresses of third parties with whom the Information was shared. If you are a California resident and would like to exercise your rights under the Shine the Light provision, please submit a request by sending an email to&nbsp;help@myprivacyrequest.com.&nbsp;In your request, please specify that you want to exercise your rights to disclosure under the Shine the Light provision please specify the Website that you visited and the email address you registered with.

<p><strong>Browser “Do Not Track” Signals.</strong>&nbsp;Most browsers contain a “do-not-track” setting. In general, when a “do-not-track” setting is active, the user’s browser notifies other websites that the user does not want their personal information and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example, for interest-based advertising. &nbsp;As required by CalOPPA, we are required to inform you that, as is the case with most websites, we do not honor or alter our behavior when a user to one of the Website has activated the “do-not-track” setting on her/his browser.</p>
