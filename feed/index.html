<p>Fluent Voices is a blog series designed to give employees across all levels and departments within our organization the opportunity to share their unique stories and passions. Our latest edition focuses on professional growth and mentorship &#8211; something we value and encourage both within Fluent and outside our walls. Below, learn how 3 key team members got to where they are today, and what pieces of career advice they wish they could give to their younger selves. </p>



<h2>Champions of Personal Growth Share Career Advice</h2>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image inline-img__margin-right"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://www.fluentco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Fluent-Voices-Don.png" alt="Career Advice - Don Patrick" class="wp-image-10289" width="250"/></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Don Patrick</strong></h2>



<p>Interim CEO, Fluent&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Think back to the beginning of your career. Did you expect to be where you are today? Where did you start, and how did you get to where you are now?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When I started my first job in investment banking, I never expected to have a 25+ year career in marketing! I believe most successful careers come down to finding and pursuing your business passions. If you are passionate about something, your career will not be about a job or a role but about what you love doing. For me, I found my passion was about building and growing businesses. I got lucky to get into digital marketing at the right time and what a great industry to grow in!”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Name a book or resource that has helped you grow in your professional life. What was the main lesson or takeaway?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am sure most of Fluent and AdParlor are tired of me saying my favorite book is “<a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/good-to-great.html#articletop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Good to Great</a>” by Jim Collins. The book is based on a lot of quantitative research and analytics around companies that have succeeded long-term compared to others that have not. One of the main findings is that every successful company has a “Hedgehog.” The Hedgehog concept is that you can build a great company and sustain it over time if you do three things well: chose something (1) you can be the best in the world at, (2) you are passionate about, and (3) that drives your economic engine (meaning you can make money). Simple and clear growth framework that can serve as a benchmark for a company, business unit, and department.” </p>



<p><strong>What is one piece of career advice you’d like to give to your younger self? </strong> </p>



<p>“The critical importance of focusing on relationships and how it is the foundation for long-term and consistent financial success.&nbsp;Too often, we are taught early in our careers&nbsp;to drive the financial numbers at all costs.&nbsp;And you can do that in the&nbsp;short term.&nbsp;But long-term, behind the financial numbers,&nbsp;are the people relationships – the ability to be direct, debate,&nbsp;and align on the right priorities. And support and encourage people on your team to develop and take risks.&nbsp;Strong relationships allow you to build high-performing teams that can put up extraordinary results.”&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image inline-img__margin-right"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://www.fluentco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Fluent-Voices-Roxanna.png" alt="Career Advice - Roxanna Flores" class="wp-image-10291" width="250"/></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Roxanna Flores</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Senior Accountant, Fluent&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Name a book or resource that has helped you grow in your professional life. What was the main lesson or takeaway?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://go.darrenhardy.com/the-compound-effect-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Compound Effect</a>” by Darren Hardy &#8211; after reading the book I realized how small changes can amount to big movements in the long-term, both personally and professionally. People always say Rome wasn’t built in a day and that resonates with every aspect of my life; it is the brick-by-brick building that has helped me become the person/professional that I am today.” </p>



<p><strong>What skills/qualities are necessary to be successful in your area of work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Consistency:&nbsp;Being consistent helps build momentum and develops trust. The more&nbsp;consistent&nbsp;you are,&nbsp;the more&nbsp;people know what to expect from you both personally and professionally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accountability: Owning up to your errors or mistakes is important for any field. Everyone is&nbsp;human,&nbsp;and everyone makes&nbsp;mistakes,&nbsp;but if you&nbsp;do not&nbsp;own up to them, you&nbsp;don’t grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Showing up: If you say&nbsp;you are&nbsp;doing something, do it! You want to be&nbsp;reliable;&nbsp;you want to be that person that&nbsp;others can&nbsp;count on,&nbsp;even for small tasks.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Who is your biggest mentor? How did you develop this relationship and what impact has it had on your career?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Professionally one of my most impactful mentors is&nbsp;a former boss. When I first graduated&nbsp;college,&nbsp;I did not have a sense of where I was going yet and&nbsp;did not have the skills that I do now. In my first job,&nbsp;my&nbsp;boss became&nbsp;my mentor&nbsp;–&nbsp;he really took the time to help me grow my skills, pushed me to be a thinker, and taught me to be accountable. Personally,&nbsp;I also think&nbsp;my Fluent mentor is&nbsp;the bomb.com.&nbsp;He truly is such a likable individual&nbsp;and always super happy&nbsp;—&nbsp;every time&nbsp;I bring up his name&nbsp;people have nothing but great things to say about him and one day (when I grow up) I would love to be like him.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is one piece of career advice you’d like to give to your younger self?</strong> </p>



<p>“I would tell myself not to be afraid of failure. Gowing up&nbsp;you are&nbsp;always&nbsp;told “no&nbsp;you can’t” or “you failed” but&nbsp;it is within those scenarios that you learn the most. The person you become is&nbsp;determined&nbsp;by&nbsp;perseverance, grit, and&nbsp;how you handle&nbsp;failures&nbsp;and step&nbsp;up to the challenges.”&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image inline-img__margin-right"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="260" height="250" src="https://www.fluentco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Fluent-Voices-Tamim.png" alt="Career Advice - Tamim Sangrar" class="wp-image-10292"/></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Tamim&nbsp;Sangrar&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Product Manager, Mobile Apps, Fluent&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Think back to the beginning of your career. Did you expect to be where you are today? Where did you start, and how did you get to where you are now? </strong> <br></p>



<p>“Absolutely not! It has been a dream journey so far—a result of hard work, support, and blessings from the almighty. I started as a User Interface Developer only 3 years ago at Deloitte, took the plunge to pursue my master’s degree in Management Information Systems, and dreamed of pursuing a career in technical product management. There were a lot of people that helped shape my journey both personally and professionally, most importantly my brother, mother, and sister provided constant support, along with my girlfriend and friends. All of them helped pick me up when I was down, motivated me, inspired me, and eventually led me to where I am right now.”</p>



<p><strong>Who is your biggest mentor? How did you develop this relationship and what impact has it had on your career?</strong> <br></p>



<p>“My biggest mentor has to be my brother, he and I have a huge age difference so that helps. Ever since I can remember, he has been either my mentor or my inspiration, he has shaped me to become the person I am today both professionally and personally. Every major career decision that I have made has been either directly or indirectly influenced by him. He always helped create an environment for learning and growth and pushed me to be ambitious and brave—with a lot of tough love!” </p>



<p><strong>A spirit of innovation is important at Fluent and AdParlor. What steps do you take to consistently learn and grow professionally?</strong> </p>



<p>“I believe the key to success is constant growth, and that growth can be achieved by consistently learning and bettering yourself. I actively engage in certifications, learnings, and watch videos by leaders in my domain, to be able to learn from them and use new tips and skills in my day-to-day.” </p>



<p><strong>What is one piece of career advice you’d like to give to your younger self? </strong> <br></p>



<p>“Learn, learn, and learn! Invest a lot of time in learning the things around you and become great at it! Also, invest in Bitcoin <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />” </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em><strong>This article originally appeared on</strong></em> <strong><em><a href="https://streetfightmag.com/2021/08/10/first-party-data-provides-opportunity-for-marketers-to-innovate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StreetFight</a></em></strong>. </p>



<p>Over a year ago, Google’s announcement that it would eliminate the use of third-party cookies by 2022 put the entire ad industry on notice. And while the deadline for this shift has since been extended to 2023, the imperative to find and implement a privacy-safe targeting alternative to the cookie has not changed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The truth is, third-party cookies were never exactly infallible, and the ad tech industry has made great strides toward developing new solutions that better serve the interests of consumers and advertisers. Companies like The Trade Desk, LiveRamp, and over 80 others have introduced new identifiers to mitigate the dependency on cookies — and help advertisers prepare for the void to be left behind.</p>



<p>But for brands looking to test the new IDs entering the market, one question looms: How do we continue to effectively target and engage consumers across channels, all while adhering to emerging privacy standards?</p>



<p>The answer lies in a strong first-party data strategy.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Get Acquainted with Your Customers</strong></h2>



<p>The evolving privacy landscape is reinforcing what we as marketers have always known – nothing is more valuable to a brand than a one-to-one relationship with its customers. Without third-party cookies to fall back on, direct connections with current and prospective customers — and the first-party data points gathered from those relationships — will become critical to facilitating targeting and personalization in a privacy-safe world.</p>



<p>Built around a consumer-first philosophy, direct-to-consumer brands have a strong understanding of, and unmediated relationship with, their customers – so it’s no surprise that they have seen so much success over the last decade. They home in on creating one-to-one experiences and collecting data on consumer preferences, ultimately making their marketing more direct and effective.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>More than Hype: First-Party Data is the Path Forward</strong></h2>



<p>Creating a core, first-party data foundation is a natural next step once you’ve started to form direct connections with your audience. In fact, first-party data has never been more important to a brand’s success — and without it, brands can anticipate an uphill challenge. First-party data is not only the most accurate data asset to leverage but it also enables marketers to better understand their core audience’s preferences and build stronger customer relationships over time.</p>



<p>The benefits of a strong first-party data strategy extend far beyond the current cookie conversation. Marketers can leverage first-party data to target specific audiences in multiple channels, while reducing dependency on third-party vendors and walled gardens. It also provides flexibility to test and measure addressable campaigns. Why is this important? Without relying on third-party measurement, cross-channel optimization and attribution become possible, increasing ROAS and efficiency. For brands that are lacking enough first-party data to conduct effective advertising at scale, it is important to tap owned channels and third-party partnerships to build out – and start reaping the rewards of – a strong first-party data asset.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Strong First-Party Data Assets Start with Trust</strong></h2>



<p>Though the inherent value of first-party data is not a new concept, many brands are prioritizing a first-party data strategy for the first time. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all strategy when it comes to first-party data collection. With <a href="https://www.fluentco.com/reports/brand-consumer-value-exchange/">59% of US adults</a>&nbsp;reporting concerns about the ways companies use their personal information, it’s crucial to prioritize transparency and trust when building a strong data asset.</p>



<p>Consumers are more privacy-aware than ever before. They expect brands to be upfront about what data they collect and how they plan to use it. Once those terms are outlined, it’s imperative to capture explicit consent – in a recent Fluent Pulse survey, we found that 71% of consumers believe it is important for brands to ask permission before sending communications.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Make It a Win-Win for Consumers</strong></h2>



<p>Despite concerns around data privacy, consumers are ultimately willing to trust brands with their personal information so long as a clear value exchange exists. Meeting that expectation will only help to increase the quality and scale of your data set. For publishers, that means producing relevant, high-quality content. For brands, it’s all about understanding consumers’ needs and highlighting the incentives that come from sharing data.</p>



<p>When coupled with compelling offers like free trials and discounts, advertisers can leverage quizzes, sweepstakes, and surveys to collect opt-in data from consumers. This type of value exchange is a win-win for all parties – brands gain insight into consumers’ interests and preferences while consumers receive valuable offers and more personalized advertising experiences.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>An Opportunity Awaits</strong></h2>



<p>It’s time to put panic in the rearview and look at the changes around us as a reset — a chance to get back to basics and build a first-party strategy from the ground up. Start by leveraging data partners, and experiment with different data collection strategies to find the best path forward. Seize the opportunity to communicate directly with customers, respond to changes in consumer sentiment, and create better experiences.</p>



<p>The loss of third-party cookies need not spell disaster for the digital advertising industry – it’s an opportunity to adapt and improve. The time has come to embrace first-party data and a consumer-centric approach to advertising.</p>

<p><strong><strong>If you were a Microsoft Office program, which program would you be, and why?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;I would be the Microsoft Office&nbsp;ClickToRun&nbsp;Installer Service because I find myself having to troubleshoot Office problems all the time.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is the funniest thing that has happened to you?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Too many to choose from, but I can answer for this week.&nbsp;Definitely playing&nbsp;a game of Catan with some friends and spending 15 minutes trading&nbsp;all of&nbsp;our cards in one turn just&nbsp;to&nbsp;slowly realize we&#8217;d basically only traded 1 card we&nbsp;actually needed.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is something you learned or gained during this internship?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;One thing that I learned while working throughout the program was the application development deployment process. In school, I never really got to work with full-scale programs, so being able to go through the entire process of development, to sandbox, to testing, to production was very informative. I’ve never used GitHub to manage application changes collaboratively among other developers through branches before, so this was also a great exercise in learning to work as a development team.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>What kind of food truck would you work at?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Probably a BBQ food truck!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What three items would you bring to a deserted island, and why?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;A sound system, because music is my life. A notepad! Being deserted would be a perfect time and setting to write a novel or autobiography (not that my life is&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;exciting).

<p><strong>What is something you learned or gained during this internship?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;This summer, I assisted Fluent&#8217;s General Counsel by analyzing the newly-passed Florida Robocall bill, which is modeled after, but more restrictive than, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. We informed the Winopoly team of the changes to the law and offered suggestions on modifications to its business practices. As advertising law continues to evolve, myself and other members of Fluent&#8217;s legal team ensure that the company, its affiliates, and external marketing partners comply with its demands.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong><strong><strong>If you were a potato, how would you be cooked?</strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>



<p>&#8220;I would love to be a Chick-Fil-A waffle fry, they are so good and so yummy. They have the perfect ratio of salt to the potato.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>What kind of food truck would you work at?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;If I could have a food truck, it would be a salad truck. It might seem kind of basic but one of my favorite foods is salad. The key to a good salad is that everything is bite-size and proportional, so I&#8217;d definitely make that happen if I worked at one.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong><strong>What is your life motto?</strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. This saying reminds me to look at the positive side of things when things don&#8217;t always go the way you thought they would. It keeps me motivated and reminds me of the importance of persevering despite any obstacles that may appear.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What three items would you bring to a deserted island, and why?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;First, I would bring coffee. I always feel something is missing whenever I skip it in the morning. I would then bring a pen and a journal. I always wanted to write a novel, but I always say I will start the next day and never end up writing anything.&nbsp;I feel being on a deserted island would definitely help me stay focused on this task as there wouldn&#8217;t be many distractions.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is something you learned or gained during this internship?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;I recently learned how to write a sales prospecting email and customize it to align with the brand’s current marketing efforts. I also had the opportunity to create an elevator pitch about AdParlor’s value proposition and practice it with my team.

<p><strong>What is the funniest thing that has happened to you?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Being on HGTV Beach Hunters was really funny because the entire thing was scripted and planned out. I had to watch my parents try to act while on camera and I had to act which we are horrible at.

I think a dinner party is best when people have cool stories to tell, and I think that is the case with all three of these men. I&#8217;m a huge Jet fan and obviously, Joe Namath is a legend and all-around cool dude. I love movies and Martin Scorsese has directed a lot of my favorites, as well as being an encyclopedia of film and filmmaking knowledge.

<p><strong>What is your life motto?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Intellectual curiosity can&#8217;t be fulfilled without humility. Before seeking knowledge, we must ask ourselves: what leads us to ask certain questions and expect specific answers? Lest we get stuck thinking our delusions are the truth.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is the funniest thing that has happened to you?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I ran into a shelf and knocked myself out immediately in the middle of a Macy&#8217;s.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is something you learned or gained during this internship?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;A goal of mine for this internship was to work cross-functionally. I have been able to witness and build perspective just from participating in product-related meetings and discussions with my boss. Working with the user perspective and different teams at Fluent, the PM guides the vision of the product. It&#8217;s necessary to take the needs and goals of all the people involved into account. As the product goes from ideation to production, different teams come and go. The PM on the other hand takes care of the product throughout its lifecycle, receiving feedback and making decisions accordingly.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>What kind of food truck would you work at?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;A Middle Eastern food truck because I could eat Arabic food every single day.&nbsp;In particular, shawarmas, kebabs, and tabbouleh.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>If you were a potato, how would you be cooked?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sweet&nbsp;potato fries. Not only are they my favorite, but they are a good mix of tangy, crisp, and sweet.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is something you learned or gained during this internship?</strong></p>



<p>“Whilst working with the Fluent Pulse team, I learned how to translate data into effective infographics that told a story. I also collaborated with my fellow interns to curate a series of newsletters using HubSpot, a CRM tool.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fluentco.com/blog/limitations-of-first-and-third-party-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last installment</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fluentco.com/tag/data-dive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Dive</a>&nbsp;blog series, we talked about&nbsp;the limitations of&nbsp;third-party cookies and&nbsp;what advertisers&nbsp;are doing to prepare for a world without them.&nbsp;Here we outline the&nbsp;benefits of a&nbsp;strong first-party data strategy&nbsp;and&nbsp;offer best practices for first-party data collection.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Emerging Alternatives to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Third-Party Cookie</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>With&nbsp;third-party cookies going away, advertisers will need to&nbsp;find a new way to facilitate targeting and personalization&nbsp;across the open web.&nbsp;Beyond contextual and cohort-based audiences,&nbsp;people-based IDs&nbsp;will play a large role in helping advertisers&nbsp;connect to platforms and partners once third-party cookies are phased out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many companies have already started&nbsp;developing&nbsp;these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/confused-about-identity-this-list-of-80-identity-partners-may-or-may-not-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative identifiers,</a>&nbsp;like LiveRamp’s RampID and The TradeDesk’s Unified 2.0. For brands looking to test the new IDs entering the market, a foundation of opted-in, first-party data will be key.</p>



<p>Let’s dive in by first&nbsp;defining the different types of data&nbsp;&#8211; and exploring why first-party data&nbsp;will be&nbsp;so important&nbsp;to a brand’s success in a post-cookie world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What’s the&nbsp;Difference&nbsp;Between&nbsp;First,&nbsp;Second, and&nbsp;Third-Party&nbsp;Data?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>First-party data is collected and owned by a brand. First-party data is differentiating (because it is proprietary), relevant (because it relates directly to the brand), and reliable (because it comes straight from&nbsp;the source).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second-party data is collected, owned, and shared by a trusted partner.&nbsp;Second-party data partners help brands achieve scale by matching their behavioral data with syndicated audience segments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third-party data is collected via multiple sources, some of them unknown, and shared by an aggregator.&nbsp;While third-party data typically offers&nbsp;the most expansive reach,&nbsp;it&nbsp;can&nbsp;often&nbsp;be&nbsp;modeled or inferred, leading to inaccuracies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Why is First-Party Data Collection So Important?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>First-party data gives brands control over their marketing destiny by&nbsp;allowing them to build real and trusting relationships with consumers. As the relationship develops, brands can better understand consumer behavior, product preferences, insights, and buying signals over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By owning a first-party data set, a brand can also test addressable marketing campaigns across&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;channels without relying on third-party measurement. Finally, with first-party data,&nbsp;brands can increase efficiency and ROAS through&nbsp;true cross-channel optimization and attribution.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Where and How to Collect First-Party Data</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>With the deprecation of third-party cookies on the horizon, brands are exploring new ways to collect opted-in&nbsp;consumer data.&nbsp;There isn’t a one-size-fits-all strategy when it comes to&nbsp;first-party&nbsp;data collection. While&nbsp;factors like scale and quality are important to consider,&nbsp;it&#8217;s crucial to prioritize transparency&nbsp;and trust when exploring the following acquisition channels:&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size">Brand Website &amp; Owned Apps:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Brand websites and owned apps can be considered the “face” of an organization. First-party data can be acquired through these channels via user registration, offers, promotions, contests, and online customer support. Some beneﬁts include consumer-driven engagement, high accuracy, and privacy controls. Drawbacks might include limited access to scale and data attributes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size">Email Campaigns:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Email campaigns&nbsp;enable brands to connect&nbsp;with vast audiences&nbsp;while also allowing for segmentation.&nbsp;Data that can be acquired through email campaigns include interest and intent. Some beneﬁts of email campaigns&nbsp;include personalized engagement, transaction-based insights, and privacy controls. Cons include limited access to attributes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size">Social Media:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Social media&nbsp;is a great way to reach new consumers and stay in touch with existing ones. Advertisers can leverage this channel to acquire polling data, customer support and feedback, and transactional data. Pros of social media may include consumer-driven engagement, ease of use, and low costs. Drawbacks include limited scale, diﬃculty gathering data, and broad data sets.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size">E-comm/POS:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>An e-commerce platform manages inventory, customer accounts, shipping, and sales data.&nbsp;An example is transactional data. Beneﬁts include large scale, accuracy, and strong behavioral data. Some drawbacks include diﬃculty giving notice to consumers and the anonymity of&nbsp;some purchase channels.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size">Data Append Partners:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Data append partners ﬁll gaps in existing information such as contact information, email addresses, and more.&nbsp;Pros of data append partners include large scale and breadth. Disadvantages include high cost and lack of insight into consumer permission and accuracy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size">Consumer Engagement Platform:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Consumer engagement platforms – like Fluent –&nbsp;help brands collect<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>self-declared insights&nbsp;directly from consumers.&nbsp;Some types of data that can be acquired through this channel include&nbsp;surveys, offers, promotions, interest and intent, and&nbsp;conquesting. Beneﬁts include&nbsp;consumer-driven engagement, accuracy,&nbsp;fully-customized&nbsp;data collection, privacy controls, and large scale &#8211; though resources are required to partner&nbsp;effectively with a platform provider.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Download&nbsp;our full cheat sheet&nbsp;on the&nbsp;pros and cons of&nbsp;first-party data acquisition&nbsp;channels&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://info.fluentco.com/hubfs/Fluent%20Downloads%20-%20Blogs/Fluent%20Cheat%20Sheet%20to%20First-Party%20Data%20Collection.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The Future of&nbsp;First-Party&nbsp;Data Collection</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We’re entering a new era in which consumers have a lot more control over their privacy. To mitigate&nbsp;the looming uncertainty, marketers need to take a privacy-focused approach to ﬁrst-party data&nbsp;collection.&nbsp;Overall,&nbsp;effective&nbsp;first-party data collection tactics&nbsp;should allow brands to&nbsp;secure explicit consent, gain insight into consumers’ interests and preferences, and deliver more personalized advertising&nbsp;experiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fluent Voices is a blog series designed to give employees across all levels and departments within our organization the opportunity to share their stories. In honor of Pride Month, we’re shining a spotlight on the LGBTQ+ community and their allies at Fluent and AdParlor. Stay tuned throughout the year as we continue to feature and celebrate more of the people that make our team unique. </p>



<h2>Reflections on Pride From the LGBTQ+ Community</h2>

<div class="wp-block-image inline-img__margin-right"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.fluentco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Fluent-Voices-Drew.jpg" alt="Drew Crawford Headshot" class="wp-image-10147" width="250" height="250" srcset="https://www.fluentco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Fluent-Voices-Drew.jpg 300w, https://www.fluentco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Fluent-Voices-Drew-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fluentco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Fluent-Voices-Drew-100x100.jpg 100w, https://www.fluentco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Fluent-Voices-Drew-200x200.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></figure></div>

<h2>Drew Crawford</h2>



<p class="subheading">Sr. Account Manager, AdParlor</p>
</div></div>



<p><strong>What led you to your current role at&nbsp;AdParlor?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good people know good people, so when a past coworker reached out about&nbsp;a&nbsp;great opportunity with an amazing culture fit, how could I say no?&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model/mentor/career influence and why?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Definitely my&nbsp;parents. My mom followed her passions through a variety of jobs, while my dad’s been at the same craft for 40 years. Regardless of what they do, they lead with their heart, they find the fun, and always treat others with respect.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Name your current favorites:</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Watching:</strong>&nbsp;Two queer-rooted reality competitions that maintain old traditions and push boundaries:&nbsp;Legendary and&nbsp;Rupaul’s&nbsp;Drag Race.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Reading:</strong>&nbsp;Anyone else been obsessing over the news for the last 5 years? Yeah…me neither.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Listening to:</strong>&nbsp;I recently discovered Coeur de Pirate while trying to learn more French.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Inspired by:&nbsp;</strong>Teachers, medics, gardeners: All the nurturers of our world.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>What does Pride Month mean to you?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Pride is a celebration of love and a constant protest in a fight for equal rights. It’s a time to thank those who’ve paved the way for equality before us, to mourn those we’ve lost too soon, a time to love ourselves and appreciate our communities, and to continue to push back on senseless conformity. We’ve come a long way, but there is so much work to be done to ensure we protect the most vulnerable in our society; regardless of their skin, how they identify,&nbsp;or who they love.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Are there any Pride-related activities you’ll be participating in this month that are especially meaningful in celebrating your identity?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;For me,&nbsp;Pride has always been about connecting with my community. I’ll be fortunate enough to celebrate with friends in person this year, but I’ll also take the opportunity to contribute to local queer businesses,&nbsp;shops,&nbsp;and restaurants proudly owned by LGBTQ+ people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m also excited to cheer on my friends at the finish line of the&nbsp;<a href="https://bikerally.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PWA Friends for Life Bike Rally</a>; a six-day bike ride from Toronto all the way to Montreal to raise money for HIV/ AIDS awareness and support.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>What do you think people can do this Pride Month to raise awareness about important issues that impact the LGBTQ+ community?</strong> </p>



<p>&#8220;I think the biggest change of hearts and minds comes from the smallest conversations. When you hear a snide remark about someone’s sexuality, or how they may present themselves, cut it at the source. Have those tough conversations with your parents, your extended family, with your kids about the strength of diversity. You never know who’s listening, and what an impact it can make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For bigger actions, you can donate to your local LGBTQ+ charities, make purchases at queer-owned businesses, and support legislation and politicians that protect gay and trans rights. It seems so simple, but these actions can and do save lives.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Patrick Sweeney</h2>



<p class="subheading">Head of People, Fluent</p>
</div></div>



<p><strong>What led you to your current role at Fluent?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was referred to Fluent, and once I met members of the team I would be working with, it was an easy decision to join!&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model/mentor/career influence and why?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Years ago, I had a chance to work for two women; Lynze Ballay and Kate Lavender.&nbsp;They each&nbsp;played an&nbsp;equally&nbsp;important role in my development and advancement.&nbsp;Both were inspiring as they were powerhouses!&nbsp;They delivered results.&nbsp;They invested their time in building meaningful relationships.&nbsp; They saw a problem and&nbsp;fixed it&nbsp;&#8211; or&nbsp;empowered others around them to&nbsp;find a solution.&nbsp; Because of them, I was given a huge opportunity to help grow the business and expand the culture.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Name your current favorites:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Watching:</strong>&nbsp;Just finished Mare of&nbsp;Easttown and Legendary&#8230;started Hacks, any suggestions???&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Reading:</strong> For fun?&nbsp;Just started, &#8220;How Y&#8217;all Doing&#8221; by Leslie Jordan.</li><li><strong>Listening to:&nbsp;</strong>When listening to music, I&#8217;m on Spotify.&nbsp;It may be cliche, but I love all the PRIDE channels.&nbsp;It&#8217;s a fun POP blend of past and current&nbsp;music.</li><li><strong>Inspired by:</strong> My family.&nbsp;Whether it be my parents, sister,&nbsp;or niece and nephew, they continuously teach and challenge me.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>What does Pride Month mean to you?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Pride is a special&nbsp;and&nbsp;important annual celebration.&nbsp;I remember being in the closet and seeing rainbow flags.&nbsp;I was so alone and craved to be a part of,&nbsp;and have&nbsp;a community.&nbsp;Over the years it has meant different things for me.&nbsp;It has been a time to come together and get more involved.&nbsp;It has been a time to create greater visibility for the community.&nbsp;And it has been an annual reminder to be proud, embrace&nbsp;my&nbsp;differences and the differences of others. I can&#8217;t forget to mention it is also an excuse to have a fabulous brunch and then watch or march in the parade.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Are there any Pride-related activities you’ll be participating in this month that are especially meaningful in celebrating your identity?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;This year I will miss NYC Pride.&nbsp;But to celebrate,&nbsp;I will be going out to brunch with friends and family. I also&nbsp;must&nbsp;give a shout-out to Fluent.&nbsp;Thanks to the hard-working&nbsp;members of our DEI Team,&nbsp;we all&nbsp;had the chance to be moved and entertained&nbsp;by the legendary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/anaquway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anastarzia&nbsp;Anaquway</a>&nbsp;as part of our Pride Speaker Series.&nbsp;It was a great reminder that there is so much work ahead for the community, but the future is bright.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talented queens within the community have often experienced a disproportionate amount of hate, violence, and discrimination, and still, they have&nbsp;been at the forefront to bring visibility to the issues and take a stand (in their impressive heels!) for what is right.&nbsp;Watching&nbsp;Starzy&nbsp;perform reminded me about the wonderful queens who&nbsp;have&nbsp;always made&nbsp;me,&nbsp;and others,&nbsp;feel&nbsp;welcomed.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>What do you think people can do this Pride Month to raise awareness about important issues that impact the LGBTQ+ community?</strong> </p>



<p>&#8220;I think the important thing to remember is that we&nbsp;can&#8217;t&nbsp;be passive all year,&nbsp;participate&nbsp;in one march,&nbsp;and think things are going to improve.&nbsp;It&#8217;s&nbsp;an annual commitment.&nbsp;It requires us to&nbsp;self-educate.&nbsp;It requires us to vote.&nbsp;It&#8217;s&nbsp;important to talk about the issues with friends and family so they understand how it&nbsp;impacts&nbsp;people.&nbsp;It&#8217;s&nbsp;important to personalize these issues.&nbsp;I want and deserve equal rights.&nbsp;These conversations are often not comfortable, but they are important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And for allies, remember language matters.&nbsp;Words can be so&nbsp;hurtful&nbsp;or so uplifting especially for people who are coming out.&nbsp;If you hear&nbsp;hurtful/hateful language or subtle microaggressions, let people know it is not okay.&nbsp;When elections occur, learn how the candidates are creating equality for all communities&nbsp;– or&nbsp;if they are supporting/initiating&nbsp;oppressive&nbsp;legislation.&nbsp;When we march, march beside us.&nbsp;And when a friend is going through&nbsp;a hard time, just listen.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>How do you show up as an ally to members of the LGBTQ+ community at work or in your personal life?</strong> </p>



<p>“For me, being an ally is about creating safe places for people to feel comfortable being their authentic selves and celebrating that. At work, that means building highly diverse teams with a strong culture of inclusion. At home, it means being a loving home base for my children &amp; their LGBTQ+ friends, some of whom are out to their families and some of whom are not.” </p>



<p><strong>What inspires you to get involved?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As an extremely proud parent of a LGBTQ+ youth, my daughter is my inspiration! While the hate and discrimination that she and her friends have experienced is something you never want your children to experience or feel, the way she rises above it is inspiring. She takes on a lot and is an advocate for all her friends. In middle school, she worked with teachers to create educational pamphlets and help launch her middle school’s <a href="https://gsanetwork.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gay-Straight Alliance</a> (GSA). In high school, she served as secretary of the ally advocacy group, Spectrum, and this year will serve as Vice President of the group. She continually educates our family, and we discuss which organizations to get involved with and support.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As mobile payment apps continue to rise in popularity,&nbsp;retailers, financial&nbsp;service providers, and tech companies are&nbsp;all looking for ways to corner their share of this growing market.&nbsp;In a&nbsp;<a href="https://fluentpulse.com/rise-of-mobile-payment-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fluent Pulse</a>&nbsp;survey of almost 17K consumers, we found that 45% of Americans use a mobile payment app today – with 33% using them more frequently vs. the same time the year prior. Offering a fast, easy, and contactless option to send payments, apps like Apple Pay and Cash App help to meet consumer demand for more seamless shopping experiences.</p>



<h2><strong>Rise of Mobile Payment Apps</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Here’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;rundown on which mobile payment apps consumers are using most often, what they value most in these services, and what marketers need to know to get ahead in this growing space.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Which mobile payment apps do you use most frequently?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In terms of popularity, Cash App (42%) and PayPal (41%) have a&nbsp;monumental&nbsp;lead over other mobile payment apps&nbsp;&#8211; with&nbsp;usage&nbsp;almost&nbsp;<strong>7x higher</strong>&nbsp;than Google Pay&nbsp;(6%),&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;Zelle&nbsp;(5%),&nbsp;Venmo (4%) and Apple Pay (2%).&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>How frequently do you use mobile payment apps?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Overall, Americans today are largely using mobile payment apps on a monthly basis (36%).&nbsp;When looking at usage trends across generations, we found:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Gen Z&nbsp;and&nbsp;Millennials are<strong>&nbsp;83%&nbsp;more&nbsp;likely</strong>&nbsp;to use mobile payment apps on a daily basis compared to Gen X.</li><li>Baby Boomers&nbsp;are&nbsp;largely&nbsp;represented as monthly users of payment apps, or&nbsp;<strong>2.5x more</strong>&nbsp;when compared to&nbsp;Gen&nbsp;Z.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.fluentco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mobile-payment-apps-01-1-1.svg" alt="How frequently do you use mobile payment apps?" class="wp-image-10126" width="684" height="379"/></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>What do you value most in a mobile payment app?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Almost half of consumers who use mobile payment apps value convenience above all else (49%), followed by the ability to make contactless payments (12%) and go cashless (10%). Comparing&nbsp;value attributes across&nbsp;generations, we found:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Gen Z&nbsp;is most likely to&nbsp;value&nbsp;rewards and discounts,&nbsp;as well as minimal transaction fees.&nbsp;When compared to Millennials, they are 70% more likely to value discounts and&nbsp;88% more likely to value low transaction&nbsp;costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Behind convenience, cashless and contactless&nbsp;payments&nbsp;resonate&nbsp;best&nbsp;with&nbsp;Baby&nbsp;Boomers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.fluentco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mobile-paymen-value-01.svg" alt="What do you value most in mobile payment app?" class="wp-image-10127" width="684" height="379"/></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>What prevents you from using mobile payment apps?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Those who don&#8217;t use mobile payment apps largely prefer using cash (45%) or are concerned about data security (24%).&nbsp;Younger generations are more likely to prefer using cash, while older generations are more concerned about data security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly,&nbsp;Gen&nbsp;Z&nbsp;and&nbsp;The&nbsp;Silent Generation&nbsp;are drawn&nbsp;away from mobile payment apps&nbsp;by better rewards&nbsp;programs offered by credit cards &#8211; 20% and 22%, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.fluentco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mobile-paymen-prevention-01.svg" alt="What prevents you from using mobile payment apps?" class="wp-image-10128" width="684" height="379"/></figure></div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>What Marketers Need to Know</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Rewards and loyalty programs help to drive adoption of mobile payment apps.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>With Americans more inclined to use a mobile payment app if they receive rewards and promotions, providers can leverage these programs to encourage adoption and drive continued use of their app.  </li><li>Gen Z is most likely to value incentives like rewards and discounts (17%), while Gen X and Baby Boomers are more inclined to start using mobile payment apps if offered special promotions.  </li></ul>



<p><strong>For some consumers, data security trumps convenience in the mobile payment arena.</strong></p>



<ul><li>While mobile payment apps offer a level of ease and convenience, data privacy&nbsp;concerns&nbsp;make some consumers reluctant to&nbsp;adopt and&nbsp;utilize&nbsp;them.&nbsp;</li><li>Compared to Gen Z and&nbsp;Millennials, US consumers over age 40 cite data security concerns as a factor preventing them from using mobile payment apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Mobile payment providers can gain favor by enforcing strict data security measures that help to build a sense of trust and ultimately validate the safety of their platforms.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p class="subheading">Survey Operations Manager, Fluent</p>
</div></div>



<p><strong>What led you to your current role at Fluent?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Originally I was working in sports marketing, then I made the switch to tech marketing. A couple of years into it I found I like working on the ops side and saw an opening at Fluent on LinkedIn &#8211; the rest is history.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model/mentor/career influence and why?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;My parents 100%. They push me every day to be the best person I can possibly be and I don’t know where I’d be without their support.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Name your current favorites:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Watching:</strong> Vincenzo (Netflix Korean drama)</li><li><strong>Reading:</strong>&nbsp;The Odyssey</li><li><strong>Listening to: </strong>And That’s Why We Drink podcast</li><li><strong>Inspired by:</strong>&nbsp;Bruce Lee</li></ul>



<p><strong>How has your heritage shaped the person you are today?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;With my mother’s side being Chinese and my father’s side being Japanese, this has played a huge role in who I am now. My grandparents on both sides immigrated to the United States to build a new life, and from them, I’ve learned resilience and discipline. My dad always liked to remind us that our Japanese side descends from a line of samurai, so he taught us to be as strong as we can – both physically and mentally. And even though these are more rigid traits, we never forget to always put kindness and generosity at the forefront – be there to give a helping hand to others, treat others with respect, and stand up for what’s right.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>In light of the current events surrounding anti-Asian-related attacks, what is something you&#8217;d like others to be aware of?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;I think it’s really important for others to know that unfortunately, these anti-Asian sentiments are nothing new &#8211; every generation has its share of stories of discrimination. My grandparents were redlined from buying a house in certain areas of Seattle, my Chinese grandfather had to wear an “I am not a Jap” button on his U.S. military uniform during WWII so he wouldn’t be mistaken as a Japanese soldier, my parents have been called derogatory names/told to go back to their countries, and my siblings and I have experienced many microaggressions – “Can you see out of your eyes?” “Just be the quiet little Asian girl and don’t speak.” “Where are you from? No where are you <em>really</em> from?” I think it’s so important for others to know that in many Asian cultures, we’re taught not to speak up, not to make a fuss or put our burdens on others and just ignore it. But because of the escalations in violence towards Asians that haven’t gotten to this level in generations, we can no longer be silent about it.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>We want our AAPI employees to feel safe and supported – how would you like allies to get involved?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;I think there are a couple of things allies can do in the immediate. The first is to have a moment of self-reflection – Have you ever cracked any Asian jokes? Have you made any sort of derogatory comments about our culture, someone’s accent, our eyes, our food, etc.? Think about that. If you or a friend/family member has, this is an opportunity to check yourself or check them. This may seem like a simple joke, but perpetuating these stereotypes has a domino effect in dehumanizing people and leading to further racism and violence.</p>



<p>A second way allies can get involved is to be aware when you’re out in the community and there are other Asians around you. It’s a scary time right now for the Asian community, and something as simple as riding the subway is nerve-wracking. I never leave my home now without my 4 self-defense weapons, and riding the subway or going to the store has become a stressful thing. So if you see someone sitting by themselves on the subway, try sitting next to them to provide a level of security. Or if you see someone being harassed, intervene if you think the situation won’t turn dangerous. If you think it might, go up to the person after and just ask if they’re okay &#8211; it will mean so much that you reached out. Maybe offer to walk them to their car or their subway stop so they feel a little safer. A single moment of reaching out to help makes a world of a difference.&#8221;</p>

<p class="subheading">Performance Graphic Designer, AdParlor</p>



<p class="subheading"><strong>What led you to your current role at AdParlor?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Complete chance honestly – I was freelancing before I started at AdParlor and actually used a lot of their tools (shout out to the <a href="https://adparlor.com/ad-mockups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ad mockup generator</a>) in a lot of the jobs I took on. Decided to shoot my shot when I saw the opening and here I am now!&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model/mentor/career influence and why?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;I’m constantly influenced by my small circle of friends and fellow creatives. I’m always learning from them (and vice versa) and it’s cool to be able to collectively grow together like this.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Name your current favorites:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Watching:&nbsp;</strong>Blackhead removal videos</li><li><strong>Reading:</strong>&nbsp;Honestly, I haven’t read a book in 8 years but I’ve been hearing really good things about Crying in H Mart by Michelle Zauner. I remember <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/crying-in-h-mart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enjoying a related article</a> a couple of years ago and have been procrastinating picking up a copy.</li><li><strong>Listening to:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5INnUqfQphgiGDskkTJFaF?si=mK9QFNd_Sz2a6jArAwTDtw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citizen &#8211; Youth</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/731aQEGKlJ8RveY3ncSekU?si=GunqhxLrQOCbuZHvFh4W4Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intervals &#8211; The Way Forward</a></li><li><strong>Inspired by:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KelLauren/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kel Lauren</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/YamamotoHikaru/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hikaru Yamamoto</a></li></ul>



<p><strong>How has your heritage shaped the person you are today?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;I grew up in a very Caucasian area, so my heritage and ethnicity are both things that have always been very hyper-visible about me. In a way, being around people who don’t look like me has reaffirmed that a large part of my identity stems from being Hong Kong-Canadian. When I was in high school, it used to be difficult discussing anything race-related considering that a majority of my school was very white and I could count on less than 2 hands the number of Asians (and, to an extent, people of color) who were in my grade. That experience had really shaped why I am very vocal about topics that affect racialized communities now.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>In light of the current events surrounding anti-Asian-related attacks, what is something you&#8217;d like others to be aware of?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Marginalized communities face different and varied struggles, but we have a lot more in common with each other than we realize; for me in particular, I’ve been reading up on the history of cross-racial solidarity in North America. During the Civil Rights Movement, Asian Americans were hugely influenced by Black leaders and communities in engaging with AsAm community education and self-reflection. Reading more about this made me realize our struggles are intersectional and fighting for liberation for one marginalized community also means fighting for liberation for all.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>We want our AAPI employees to feel safe and supported – how would you like allies to get involved?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;A really simple way is just checking in on your AAPI friends and coworkers and seeing how they’re doing – it’s been a tough while for us and everyone will deal with that differently. Ask if there’s anything you can do to directly support them in the moment &#8211; like a distraction to take their mind off things or offer to buy them a meal. And as always, I encourage allies to seek resources and educate themselves on their own time; with activism and allyship, the work isn’t ever &#8216;truly finished.&#8217; They’re both based on a lifetime of accountability and learning and unlearning new information presented to you.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Alice Ly</h2>



<p class="subheading">Sr. Manager, Branded Content, Fluent</p>



<p><strong>What led you to your current role at Fluent/AdParlor?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;I was referred by Caleb K. (we worked together right before Fluent) and thanks to him I get to work with the most awesome team I’ve ever worked with (hey, <a href="https://thesmartwallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Smart Wallet</a> team!) and a wonderful company. This is also my first FT remote job (prior to COVID) and I love being able to work from home as well as occasionally visiting the amazing New York headquarters.</p>



<p>My previous roles mixed marketing, community management, and content creation and design together, which I get to utilize to this day. It is definitely never boring!&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model/mentor/career influence and why?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Besides my parents instilling a strong work ethic in me by example (they worked in the restaurant industry) and teaching me to be financially independent, my first manager, Jeannie H., influenced my career. It was inspiring to see her balance work, family, and the communication finesse she had between the different teams in the organization. &nbsp;At the same time, she gave me valuable opportunities that I deeply appreciated.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Name your current favorites:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Watching:&nbsp;</strong>Invincible (on Amazon Prime) = If you’ve watched The Boys, this is even more intense</li><li><strong>Reading:</strong>&nbsp;How Stella Learned to Talk by Christina Hunger = A speech-language pathologist’s journey to teaching her dog to talk using speech buttons</li><li><strong>Listening to:</strong> Video Game Study Lounge playlist as work music = Music with lyrics distract me, so all I listen to while working are instrumental or in a foreign language!</li><li><strong>Inspired by:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/the.korean.vegan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@the.korean.vegan</a> on IG = I&#8217;m not vegan but she marries storytelling with food so well it&#8217;s fascinating to watch and learn from!</li></ul>



<p><strong>How has your heritage shaped the person you are today?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;My Chinese heritage has gifted me with being thrifty and a lover of all things food-related. Both traits are common in general Asian cultures, and I embrace them wholeheartedly.</p>



<p>My parents worked long hours to provide for the family, and their way of stretching the dollar by not being wasteful, or reusing/upcycling items, and keeping an eagle eye out for sales has definitely passed on to me. Yes, I do have extra napkins in my glove compartment and a drawer full of plastic takeout containers that I&#8217;ll reuse <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Asians (parents and relatives) show their love by cooking and offering food (not hugs and kisses) so I&#8217;ve been well-fed my entire life. I will also gladly give you a list of restaurants, mom-and-pop places, and cafes if you don&#8217;t know where to eat!</p>



<p><strong>In light of the current events surrounding anti-Asian-related attacks, what is something you&#8217;d like others to be aware of?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;I believe it&#8217;s hard for some to understand that anti-Asian racism has always been present. There are also those that still think &#8220;it can&#8217;t be <em>that</em> bad.&#8221; Only due to <em>some</em> media covering the attacks, it&#8217;s getting more attention. It’s an unfamiliar spotlight for us but a necessary one. My parents told me they were screamed at while walking back home from the park, and my mom recently accompanied me to Downtown Los Angeles, later telling me she felt scared to be there. This is the reality that our parents and seniors are facing. They may not admit it, but internally they’re shaken.</p>



<p>For those interested in learning more, I suggest following <a href="https://nextshark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NextShark</a> (their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nextshark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IG page</a> is great too) to stay updated on Asian and Asian American news to see the bigger picture. If you can stomach a more raw look into the hate incidents, I would suggest following <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dionlimtv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@DionLimTV</a> on IG, an ABC7 San Francisco reporter that posts unfiltered news and imagery to show how severe the attacks are, particularly to the elder community.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>We want our AAPI employees to feel safe and supported – how would you like allies to get involved?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Local Asian businesses are hurting from the combined forces of 2 viruses &#8211; one from COVID and the other from hate. If you can help support your local Asian business, even online, it would mean the world to them. This can also include donating to families affected by AAPI hate, organizations that work on rebuilding and supporting Asian businesses and communities, as well as many others that could be found <a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/article/where-to-donate-to-help-asian-communities-2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. And thank you, Fluent, for matching employee donations as well!</p>



<p>Another way to help &#8211; If you do witness a hate incident, try and assist the victim if you can. I learned about the 5 Ds of bystander intervention (distract, delegate, document, delay, and direct) from <a href="https://www.ihollaback.org/bystander-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollaback!</a>, a non-profit that raises awareness and provides resources to combat harassment. </p>

<p class="subheading">Sr. Director, Biddable Media, Fluent</p>



<p><strong>As an ally, how do you advocate for positive social change in support of the Asian community?</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;In my opinion, being an ally and supporting positive social change for our Asian community starts with education and empathy. My fiancé, who is of Chinese descent, experienced an act of hate at the beginning of the pandemic. My initial reaction was pure anger &#8211; which I think is normal when someone you love experiences any act of hate or is threatened. However &#8211; after the hate subdued, I asked my fiancé what I could do to help. She simply wanted me to listen to how she was feeling and understand this disgusting behavior against our Asian community is not new and has been going on for decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For me personally, the upsurge in violence and increased coverage of hate against our Asian community have created a long list of emotions. Initially, I wanted to take action and do anything and everything in my power to help, but it took time and acknowledgment to realize that before I could make positive social change &#8211; I needed to be educated and purely listen first.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Akanksha Joshi</h2>



<p class="subheading">Senior Data Engineer, Fluent</p>
</div></div>



<p><strong>What led you to the role you&#8217;re in today?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My curiosity and eagerness to build something purposeful brought me here. Having been in a support role before, I always wanted to be a part of a product right from its inception. This required me to take a bold step to change my career and pursue a higher degree. My resilience to not settle in my comfort zone and my passion to bring a positive change around me helped in my journey. Fluent is a progressive place to work, providing immense growth opportunities, an inclusive work culture, and a nurturing environment.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model/career influence and why?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My mother is my biggest role model. I have learned a lot from her growing up. Hard-working, resilient, and compassionate are some of the many adjectives that describe her. I remember two very important lessons that she taught my sister and me &#8211; First, it is of utmost importance for everyone to be financially independent, especially women. And second, one should never be hesitant to speak up when they believe that they are right.&nbsp;Both of these&nbsp;lessons have stayed with me ever since.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is one of your proudest&nbsp;career&nbsp;accomplishments?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am really excited for where I am in my career right now. My journey from being a college graduate to having a prominent role in a data-driven environment and rapidly growing organization is something that I am proud of. Looking back, I am grateful for all the challenging situations that have tested me. I am proud of my pursuit to set up a strong process for myself that has helped me achieve my goals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you’d give to the next generation of women leaders?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the most important things I’d ask of every woman is to Speak Up! – Speak up for yourself, speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, speak up for equity and inclusion, speak up to challenge gender biases, and speak up for everything YOU believe in.”</p>

<h2>Jessica Jeffers</h2>
</div></div>



<p class="subheading">Senior Media Manager, AdParlor</p>



<p><strong>What led you to the role you&#8217;re in today?</strong></p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>“A LOT! I’m originally from Manchester, UK, and after having lived in London for a few years, I started to get itchy feet and wanted to start a new chapter. I made the huge decision in 2019 to apply for a working holiday visa, pack my bags, and move across the pond to start a new adventure in Toronto! I’ve had a couple of roles here, but my latest position at AdParlor was the result of wanting to move to the next stage of my career. I was so excited by the fact the Sr. Media Manager role was brand new, in a brand new division for AdParlor – the Performance Team &#8211; and I was thrilled by the prospect of growing something from the ground up. Today I can say we’ve done/are doing that!”</p>



<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model/career influence and why?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My biggest role model is my mum! She moved countries from Ghana when she was in her early twenties too so I can relate to her on that level. She’s in the medical profession and had to get used to a whole new culture, country, and train to be a midwife all at the same time. Both her and my dad have always been so supportive of me making the move to Canada and have  encouraged me to take risks&nbsp;and also&nbsp;enjoy the achievements and the special moments. They’ve also taught me to embrace my ambitious nature and never to be afraid to throw myself out of my comfort zone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is one of your proudest career accomplishments?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s fairly recent! The whole BLM movement last year was so poignant for me and I really took the time to assess where I am and how I feel. I’m proud of how far I have come and representing my community in a senior position within such a diverse workplace. Being asked to participate in the Fluent Speaker Series “Black Lives Matter vs. All Lives Matter” panel was a proud moment in my career because I was able to represent Black women&nbsp;in my workplace&nbsp;&#8211; and the reactions and responses from the team were so warm and loveable. It’s also now taught me where I want to go from here &#8211; to achieve more and keep rising up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you’d give to the next generation of women leaders?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To the next generation of&nbsp;women leaders,&nbsp;I would say, OWN your voice. No matter your background, culture, or who you are, you’ve earned your right to take the stage and be heard. It took me some time to find mine when it comes to being in a work environment, but thanks to being surrounded by some very aspirational women in my career, I’ve found it and run with it. I wouldn’t be in the position I am today without having followed the advice I have been given along the way.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Kerry Sorenson</h2>



<p class="subheading">Director of Data Operations, Fluent</p>



<p><strong>What led you to the role you&#8217;re in today?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“In college, I interned and eventually accepted a position as an account manager at a different lead gen company. In 2015, I was referred to Fluent by a former co-worker to become Fluent’s second Data Account Manager. I quickly realized I was much more interested in operations than account management, and the rest is history!”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model/career influence and why?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At Fordham, I graduated with a BS in marketing and an entrepreneurship concentration. My concentration course load was led by a badass professor, Christine Janssen. She has forever inspired me.&nbsp;Oh,&nbsp;and my mom of course!”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is one of your proudest career accomplishments?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think it’s really cool to have been one of the OG operations team members at Fluent (aside from Winnie of course). I’ve loved watching the operations teams transform and grow over the years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you’d give to the next generation of women leaders?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t be afraid to speak up / It’s okay to wear your heart on your sleeve.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Brooke Robinson</h2>



<p class="subheading">VP of Performance, AdParlor</p>



<p><strong>What led you to the role you&#8217;re in today?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve had an eclectic career in marketing and advertising over the past 10+ years. I’ve worked client-side and agency-side, always moving in a direction that would teach me something new. I was motivated by learning and that has taught me to work with the right people. I’m forever a mentor and a mentee and I chose my current role because of the team – those who would be my leaders and inspire me, my colleagues,&nbsp;and the opportunity to help others navigate through challenges in the advertising world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model/career influence and why?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The foundation of my career has been built on working with strong women who took the time to coach me because they saw potential. Early in my career, I was in awe of Mary&nbsp;DePaoli&nbsp;(now EVP and CMO at RBC Bank) for being such a forward-thinking executive who worked her way on to the executive board at Sun Life Financial&nbsp;– a company&nbsp;where a&nbsp;CMO&nbsp;did&nbsp;not previously have&nbsp;a seat at the table. While she was my CMO at Sun Life, she gave me opportunities that inspired me and has&nbsp;continued to&nbsp;support me throughout my career when I’ve needed it most. I strive to be the kind of women that inspires&nbsp;others, in the way that Mary inspired me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is one of your proudest career accomplishments?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;                        </p>



<p>“My proudest career accomplishment to date is seeing my former mentees excelling in new roles &#8211; women like Amanda Atkins (now Marketing Manager, Intuit) who was my protégé while at&nbsp;GroupM. These talented women are now excelling in roles that didn’t even exist 5 years ago and that makes me proud. Second to seeing the success of those I’ve coached along the way, was launching my own consulting business in 2018. I was struggling with what to do next and launching my own business brought me back to the ground floor – building something from nothing. It was humbling, it was challenging, and while I may return to&nbsp;an&nbsp;entrepreneurial role&nbsp;someday,&nbsp;my role at&nbsp;AdParlor&nbsp;has allowed&nbsp;me to marry&nbsp;my&nbsp;love for building something from the ground up&nbsp;and&nbsp;inspiring talented&nbsp;young marketers to do great things!”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you’d give to the next generation of women leaders?</strong>&nbsp;                                                                                                          </p>



<p>“Follow good people, and they will lift with you. It took me a while to shift from chasing an opportunity to following those that inspire me, but I love the past experiences for shaping the person I am today.”</p>

<h2>Jennifer Burrington</h2>



<p class="subheading">Head of Sales, Vesey Studios (Fluent)</p>



<p><strong>What led you to the role you&#8217;re in today?</strong><br></p>



<p>&#8220;20+ years of career experience in mobile phones/devices; from 1999 to 2021. Evolving my knowledge and experience along with the technology from finance to marketing, wireless carriers to app stores, and mobile gaming to mobile/digital advertising. Being part of the convergence of mobile platforms with digital advertising was really phenomenal.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model/career influence and why?</strong><br></p>



<p>&#8220;I’m inspired and influenced by the creativity of entrepreneurship. The way entrepreneurs need to think outside the “box” to build entire companies through vision, strategy, and innovation. I’m often very inspired by female entrepreneurs by the way they are never stopped by roadblocks, the way they break down walls, eliminate ceilings, and disrupt all of the stereotypes. Entrepreneurs of all kinds have motivated me throughout my career.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>What is one of your proudest career accomplishments?</strong><br></p>



<p>&#8220;Joining an early stage start-up in 2006 while in seed funding as the fifth employee and only woman. Helping build the company through Series C and its acquisition by Conversant in 2011. It was one of the first mobile advertising networks and I learned so much about growing a business, mobile technology, innovation, emerging market sales, marketing, teamwork, focus and vision, sales management, and entrepreneurship. Most importantly, I learned how to use my voice as a woman in a business and industry that was predominantly male.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you’d give to the next generation of women leaders?</strong><br></p>



<p>&#8220;It’s not only OK to break the mold, to disrupt the stereotypes, and change expectations; it is what is right for you and what is empowering for all women. Lead the way and find a new path; it may be covered with tall grasses and weeds, but you can make it accessible to future generations of women.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Marina White</h2>



<p class="subheading">Director of Business Analysis, Fluent</p>



<p><strong>What led you to the role you&#8217;re in today?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I realized that I love analytics and could&nbsp;be good at it&nbsp;pretty early&nbsp;on. I just kept&nbsp;working at&nbsp;it,&nbsp;always adopting&nbsp;new ideas and tools&nbsp;so it never&nbsp;became&nbsp;boring.&nbsp; My peers are very&nbsp;smart,&nbsp;and we feed each other ideas, so it is a very rewarding field to be in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Who is your biggest role model/career influence and why?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My academic advisers gave me a lot –&nbsp;starting with school and then to college and grad school I had great women who taught me and nurtured me.&nbsp; Each of them had a unique approach and they taught me how to keep moving forward.&nbsp; And even if I failed,&nbsp;as a&nbsp;next step, I would challenge myself to&nbsp;try something more difficult.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>What is one of your proudest career accomplishments?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“When I started to lead analytics groups, I saw how great it was to&nbsp;watch&nbsp;other&nbsp;people succeed.&nbsp; I am pretty sure that&nbsp;everyone I’ve worked with has had&nbsp;a&nbsp;flourishing career.&nbsp; I’ve been&nbsp;in situations after corporate mergers&nbsp;where new&nbsp;people came to my group that were not considered A players&nbsp;–&nbsp;I saw their strengths and we worked together to realize potential.&nbsp; It was great to see how their careers&nbsp;skyrocketed,&nbsp;some&nbsp;even leaving&nbsp;to get positions higher than mine.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you’d give to the next generation of women leaders?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Code or learn&nbsp;another technical skill –&nbsp;it can help to set the&nbsp;foundation&nbsp;for a&nbsp;great and long career.&nbsp; Find friends and colleagues with whom to laugh – this is a foundation of positivity.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="font-size:32px"><strong>Reflections &amp; Predictions: Affiliate Marketing Trends</strong></h2>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3><strong>What was your biggest learning from 2020?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong><em>Tim&nbsp;Antoian</em></strong><strong><em>, Fluent&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have personally always lived by the motto that &#8216;what worked well one day, won&#8217;t necessarily work well the next.&#8217; 2020 really found ways to test this motto and push advertisers to the limit. I think we as an industry learned a lot &#8212; how to improve our communication infrastructure, and really dig deep to find a way to flourish during this challenging period. A steady rise in Internet traffic changed how people interact online, and naturally, how and where advertisers could engage those consumers. Yet even as marketing budgets shrunk in the face of economic uncertainty, performance marketing programs remained a reliable and cost-effective channel for driving customer acquisition and overall growth. 2020 ultimately taught us that complacency is dangerous. Diversification and constant testing are the keys to survival in our evolving digital marketing landscape.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Brittany Christopher, Cake</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The resiliency of affiliate marketing! Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn, affiliate marketing gained even more traction. At the tail end of Q1 2020, advertising budgets were reduced and scrutinized even further as many brands felt the initial impacts of COVID-19. Unfortunately, for many marketers, reduced budgets increase the pressure to run campaigns that are both measurable and produce results. As a result, many organizations were looking to diversify their&nbsp;ad&nbsp;spend&nbsp;and focus on channels that have the lowest risk and highest ROI. With more consumers buying online, affiliate marketing became one of the most reliable channels that marketers could turn to as it is both measurable and&nbsp;performance-based. By July 2020, search traffic for “affiliate marketing”&nbsp;<a href="https://mediakix.com/blog/affiliate-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached its highest peak in 11 years</a>,&nbsp;and in 2021&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/693438/affiliate-marketing-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">affiliate spend in the U.S. alone is expected to reach $7.4 billion</a>, an even greater increase from 2020 numbers.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong><em>Susan Weiner, What If Media Group</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The innovation, adaptability, and resilience of the affiliate marketing space.&nbsp;The pandemic changed the way our society functions, and with that, the types of offers that once resonated with consumers either were no longer of interest, or simply no longer relevant. There was a big unknown in the early days of the pandemic as to how big of an impact there would be on ad spends. </p>



<p>Our advertising partners very quickly pivoted both on offer development and messaging, but it was incredibly refreshing to see that not one of our clients looked to exploit the virus itself&nbsp;as a means to&nbsp;generate sales vs. adding value to peoples’ lives during these difficult times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was also incumbent on What If Media Group to make performance marketing campaigns more efficient than ever. It is amazing what you can do when you spend 90% of the time in your home! Out of our efforts came the launch of our new artificial intelligence platform for performance marketing, ARIA, which uses a series of algorithms to zero in on consumers who are most likely to convert and quickly scale campaigns. The end result&nbsp;was better than we could have expected, and ARIA has positioned us to take on new advertising verticals as we enter 2021.&#8221;</p>



<h3><strong>What are some of your predictions for 2021?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong><em>Tim&nbsp;Antoian, Fluent</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think we’re all a bit more comfortable with the &#8216;new normal&#8217; coming out of 2020. Those that were able to adapt, did so and survived. As the economy starts to open back up, I expect certain niches like tourism and travel will start to increase their budgets again. I expect advertisers will continue to invest in digital, and more specifically, performance-based campaigns.&nbsp;In recent years there has been a noticeable trend in&nbsp;affiliate&nbsp;marketing away from top-of-funnel&nbsp;payouts, like clicks and installs, towards “deeper funnel” billable actions, like a sale or paying customer.&nbsp;This trend will likely continue in the new year, as&nbsp;there is less turnover and focus on short-term wins among&nbsp;affiliates, and more opportunity to grow long-lasting partnerships.&nbsp;2021&nbsp;will have its own set of challenges, but its own set of opportunities as well. I, for one, am excited to see what new innovations arise from this period of rapid change.”</p>



<p><strong><em>Brittany Christopher, Cake</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Affiliate networks will continue to expand their affiliate programs and explore additional revenue opportunities to monetize their traffic. In 2020, we saw a 50 percent increase in the number of CAKE customer’s leveraging the powerful combination of affiliate marketing and lead distribution as it provides new opportunities to monetize leads beyond what’s possible with just affiliate click traffic alone. With lead distribution, affiliate networks play an imperative role in attaining higher-quality leads that can be sold for a premium CPL, as opposed to general conversion traffic. Plus it expands the playing field for new verticals and opens up access to more affiliate and advertiser partners in that new vertical. </p>



<p>For advertisers, this results in pre-qualified leads that match very specific criteria. For affiliates, they gain access to a wider audience of advertisers. In this scenario, the affiliate network, affiliate, and advertiser all benefit. It is likely this trend will continue into 2021 and beyond as this combination enables all partners with greater revenue opportunities and the chance for networks to diversify their affiliate program.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong><em>Susan Weiner, What If Media Group</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Consumers continue to demand greater transparency concerning how companies collect, use and share their data. That means we will see further growth of data privacy and security regulations in 2021, as more states enact their own versions of the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) and the recently passed and more expansive California Consumer Privacy Rights Act (CRPA). Differing state laws will further support a move to Federal privacy regulations, which is likely under the new Administration, although we predict most movement will happen after 2021. Regardless, the FTC’s enforcement of privacy regulations will only increase, so companies in the affiliate marketing space must be prepared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not good for Big Tech, but it will certainly even the playing field for smaller companies, especially those that collect self-reported, first-party consumer data, and offer a competitive advantage to companies that are more transparent concerning data privacy practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also generally feel that 2021 will be as unpredictable as last year.&nbsp;And that unpredictability will likely result in overall ad spending continuing to decline.&nbsp;But that decline mostly missed digital in 2020, and we believe that more dollars will continue to shift toward online, performance-based media spending this coming year from both&nbsp;direct to consumer&nbsp;advertisers as well as more traditional brands.&#8221;</p>



<h3><strong>What can advertisers do to optimize existing partnerships and identify new ones in the coming year?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong><em>Tim&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Antoian</em></strong><strong><em>, Fluent</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The most effective relationships between advertisers and&nbsp;affiliates&nbsp;are no longer solely transactional.&nbsp;Because both parties interact with the consumer at different stages of the customer journey, they must&nbsp;work as a cohesive unit to drive&nbsp;the best consumer experience.&nbsp;Advertisers should look to build&nbsp;strategic partnerships&nbsp;rooted in trust, transparency, and&nbsp;a shared definition of success.&nbsp;Beyond aligning on objectives, it is also important that advertisers and affiliates have the right tech and tracking capabilities in place to measure performance and drive optimizations. Once an advertiser understands the types of partnerships that work best for their business, they can use those relationships as a framework for identifying and pursuing new opportunities.”</p>



<p><strong><em>Brittany Christopher, Cake</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fostering direct, long-term relationships with affiliates that are built on a foundation of trust and true performance is vital for advertisers looking to build a profitable affiliate program. One of the best ways advertisers can optimize their existing partnerships is to treat affiliates like they are an extension of their own team. These relationships are important to the success of your overall program’s profitability. Reward affiliates with higher payouts for high-quality traffic and provide transparency into conversion data and performance metrics so that your affiliates can optimize the traffic they are driving to your landing page and provide you with the best results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For advertisers looking to identify new affiliate partnerships, there are four actionable ways to connect with new partners:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Meet affiliates in-person at industry conferences (when they resume of course) such as Affiliate Summit, Affiliate World, India Affiliate Summit,&nbsp;PerformanceIN&nbsp;Live, and events specific to your vertical.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Join popular online social media groups on LinkedIn and Facebook to start identifying new partners and building relationships. These groups often provide helpful insights about both good partners that you want to work with and bad partners that you will want to avoid.&nbsp;</li><li>Offer competitive and enticing payouts to gain a competitive advantage and attract publishers to join your affiliate program over the competition.&nbsp;</li><li>Build a referral program to incentivize existing affiliates to refer new affiliates to your affiliate program. If your affiliates are properly rewarded for their&nbsp;referrals&nbsp;they will be even more likely to continue introducing new affiliates to you.&#8221;</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Susan Weiner, What If Media Group</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Look for partners who can deliver an omnichannel approach.&nbsp; Very few customers buy on their first visit or exposure to an ad. There are typically multiple touchpoints that lead to&nbsp;the end result&nbsp;of acquiring a customer.&nbsp; The key is to find a partner who can seamlessly reach a consumer across multiple channels, and then thoroughly analyze at what points consumers choose to engage.&nbsp;Leveraging that front-end information along with the advertisers&#8217; own data, ensures that they are maximizing ROI.&#8221;</p>
